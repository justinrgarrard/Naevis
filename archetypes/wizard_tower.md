# Wizard: Tower Mage

_Tower Mages are recluses that practice their arts away from civilization, developing a particular talent for scroll scribing. Many run their own ateliers supplying buyers with handmade scrolls._


#### Read Magic

When you take this archetype at 2nd level, you learn to use scrolls from outside your spell list. You can cast these spells using your Wizard spellcasting modifier, but cannot add them to your spellbook.


#### Transmute Scroll

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to improvise spell scrolls. As an action, you expend your Arcane Recovery to magically duplicate one of the spells in your spellbook. The chosen spell must be of a level that you would otherwise recover using Arcane Recovery, and is stored within your spellbook on a blank page. If the scroll is not used within 24 hours, the page it's written upon crumbles to dust.


#### Scroll Arts

At 6th level, when you cast a spell from a scroll, you can enhance it in one of the following ways:

* **Distant**: If the spell has a range of 5 feet or more, the range doubles. It the spell has a range of touch, it increases to 30 feet.
* **Extend**: If the spell has a duration of one round or longer, the duration of the spell doubles, to a maximum of 24 hours.
* **Empower**: If the spell deals damage, you can reroll a number of damage dice equal to the scroll's spell level and take the new result.


#### Preserve Scroll

Beginning at 10th level, roll a d20 after casting a spell from a scroll. If the result is less than or equal to your Intelligence modifier, the scroll does not crumble to dust after use, but cannot be used again for 24 hours.


#### Deep Reserves

At 14th level, you gain a second use of Arcane Recovery.
