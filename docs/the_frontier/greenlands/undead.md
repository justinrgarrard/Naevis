# Undead

#### Natural Undead

When a practitioner of magic dies, an undead creature will occasionally arise in their place. Ghosts are the most common, followed by revenants and vampires. These creatures bear a resemblance to their creator but possess no relation to their creator. They are bestial, barely cognizant things driven by hunger or emotion.

#### Necromantic Constructs

A few unsavory wizards and cultists have been known to dabble in "True Necromancy", the use of magic to create synthetic undead. The resulting creatures are golem-like entities that follow their master's orders without thought or intelligence. Like natural undead they have no memories of their former lives.

#### The Wizard Kings

Ancient human tribes proficient in [Abyssal](../../more/languages/secret) once sought to rule the world through armies of the dead and nearly succeeded. The second emperor of the [Elven Empire](../greenlands/elves) narrowly avoided catastrophe by exterminating every individual possessed of that talent. To date, humans who inherit an aptitude for Abyssal are put to death in Elven lands (and generally shunned elsewhere).
