# Dwarves

#### Overview

Comparatively much smaller than the Elven Empire, Dwarven City-States like Argos and Moorlock are mountain fortress that resist any attempt at invasion. Each is ruled by a council of Dwarven patricians from well-established clans. Hilly regions adjacent to the mountain cities are mined and worked by human serfs.

#### Mos Maiorum

Dwarven society is ordered around a set of social norms and cultural expectations shared across clans. Certain behaviors are expected of a Dwarf, and those that fail to live up to the ideal may find themselves shunned or even exiled. Valued qualities include ambition, martial prowess, and magnanimity.

#### The Legions

Military service is a stepping stone in many a Dwarf's political career. The Legions are responsible for protecting the mountains, maintaining infrastructure, and conquering enemy holdings. Historically, "enemy" has referred to other Dwarf clans, and has only come to mean Elves in the past few generations.

#### Humanity

Human inhabitants can be divided into two categories: freedmen and slaves. The former are workers and craftsmen of modest means. The latter are treated as little better than cattle, worked mercilessly in mines and other dangerous fields. Neither can hold citizenship.
