# The Frontier

#### The City Below

The City Below, also called the **Forgotten City** or the **City Itself**, is a subterranean otherworld. It was discovered several years prior in the Nameless Desert. The great powers of Naevis covet its treasures.

#### The Canvaslands

A lawless shantytown of yurts and market stalls that sprung up around the City's entrance. Within its unmarked boundaries are tradesmen, soldiers, camp followers, and aspiring adventurers. 

<!-- A few national embassies stand watch over the region, keeping careful watch over the items and delvers that return from the City Below. -->

#### The Nameless Desert

A vast arid desert prone to sandstorms and drought. Megafauna like giant ants, giant scorpions, and sand worms hunt for unsuspecting wanderers foolish enough to venture in without a guide.
