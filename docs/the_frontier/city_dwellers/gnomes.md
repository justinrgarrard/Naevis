# Gnomes

#### Overview

Small and pale skinned, gnomes most closely resemble halflings in size and shape. A few scholars have theorized that they may even _be_ halflings, removed by dozens of generations.  They are talented illusionists that rarely show their true forms.

#### Settlements

Gnomish settlements are entirely unknown to surface dwellers. Given their mastery of illusion magic, they are presumably well-hidden. More disturbing are rumors that gnomes walk among the surface dwellers while wearing carefully magicked disguises.

#### Disposition

Gnomes are secretive and curious. Their survival strategy hinges upon outmaneuvering dangerous foes through superior knowledge and cunning trickery. They are also inherently magical creatures; their blood trades for a high price in Canvasland markets.
