# The Nine Devil Princes

#### Overview

Reports of the Devil Princes are tinged with awe, fear, and religious reverence. City Dwellers describe them as immortals from the dawn of time, capable of great and terrible magic, the most well-known of which is shapeshifting. Folk tales tell of a Prince who took the form of a swarm of beetles to listen to every word of heresy spoken in a village before punishing them exactly to the degree that they sinned. Another myth describes a Prince who became a mass of floating eyes and turned an entire city to stone.

#### Disposition

Reports of the Princes' mentalities vary greatly. Some legends have them behaving much like mortals. They take paramours, they revenge themselves on enemies (usually their siblings), and they are occasionally moved to generosity. Other legends portray them as inscrutable beings whose alien mindset is incomprehensible even to their own worshippers.

#### Existence

Surface dwellers to-date have not encountered any of the Devil Princes. The prevailing view among scholars is that they are simply a fiction invented by primitive City creatures.
