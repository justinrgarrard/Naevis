# Coldbloods

#### Overview

A grouping that encompasses kobolds, lizardfolk, dragonborn, yuan-ti, and nagas. Coldbloods are believed to be a single race that develops differently depending on life stage and diet. They are the most alien of the City Dwellers.

#### Settlements

Coldbloods live in or near sources of water. Underground rivers and lakes are near exclusively their territory. They create leather tents on the beach shores, but scholars believe that much of their architecture is below water. Their societies are presumed to be matriarchal dictatorships.

#### Disposition

Coldbloods are ruthlessly pragmatic. They will attempt negotiation if they see benefit in it, and will break agreements without remorse the moment they profit.
