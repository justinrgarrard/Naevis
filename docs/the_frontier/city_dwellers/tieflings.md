# Tieflings

#### Overview

Tieflings resemble elves with a more bestial aspect. They have claws, fangs, horns, and eyes that glow in darkness. Their societies are cutthroat aristocracies fueled by magic.

#### Settlements

Tieflings live in underground cities carved directly into stone walls. They are a powerful race whose caste system is organized by magical prowess, with the weakest practitioners living as little more than slaves. 

#### Disposition

Tieflings are, on the whole, are cruel and arrogant. Their culture extolls the virtues of repaying favors and grudges several-fold. Most are lacking in any form of genuine empathy, believing it to be a mark of weak moral fiber.
