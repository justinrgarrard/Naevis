# City Dwellers

<!-- #### The City Above

The entrance to the City Below is a ruin, the broken remnants of some unknown nation. Shattered sandstone walls and collapsed adobe brick buildings are scattered throughout the region. Sinkholes in basements and former courtyards open up into underground tunnels, which in turn connect to the Forgotten City proper. -->

<!-- #### Denizens of the City

Among the monsters and dangers of the City are thinking creatures, capable of speech and reason. Their very existence is something of a controversy among the Kindred (who have long thought themselves the sole stewards of Naevis). -->

#### Language

Unlike the Kindred, City Dwellers share the same spoken [language](../../more/language) (Undercommon) and written language (Infernal) regardless of race. They are notably not proficient in Common.

#### Magic

City Dwellers do not use magic as Kindred do. They are neither wizards nor clerics, instead seeming to practice entirely distinct traditions of spellcraft. They are generally superior spellcasters, and all are capable of using spell scrolls.

#### Technology

While inhabitants of the City tend to have stronger magic, their technological prowess is considerably weaker. Their weapons are made of stone and bone, and their clothing is made of monster hides.

#### Architecture

Buildings are uncommon in the City Below. Underground living is largely bereft of weather and seasons, removing one of the main impetuses for lasting shelters. Instead, camps and decorated caves make up the most common living quarters. Most are charmed with exotic forms of warding to sound alarms or rebuke trespassers.

#### Religion

Denizens of the City worship the [Nine Devil Princes](devil_princes), a pantheon of supposed demigods. These Princes have no known cult in the surface world. Where the gods of Kindred are held to exist outside of the physical world, the Devil Princes are rumored to walk among their followers in the flesh. 

#### Economy

City Dwellers operate on a barter economy. Scrolls are the nearest approximation of currency, being both lightweight and useful for daily life.
