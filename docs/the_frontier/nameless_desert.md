# The Nameless Desert

#### Geography

Rolling sand dunes crest and fall for hundreds of miles in every direction. The burning sun bleaches the sand a perfect, blinding white. On rare cloud-filled days the desert is indistinguishable from the sky. Rumor has it that halfling villages can be found along secret oases.

#### Wildlife

* **Sand Worms**: Scaled monstrosities that can grow to sixty feet in diameter and twice that in length. They largely feed on minerals and Giant Ants underground, but will opportunistically eat Kindred aboveground.

* **Dire Vultures**:  A bird creature with a twenty-foot wingspan, capable of picking up lightweight Kindred and dashing them against the rocks below. Frighteningly intelligent.

* **Giant Ants**: Three-foot long ants, aggressive and single-minded in their determination to acquire food for the hive.

* **Giant Scorpions**: Scorpions the size of hounds that hide themselves in the sand. Highly venomous.

* **Giant Spiders**: Burrowing spiders roughly two feet in length. Actively avoids Kindred, preferring to prey on Giant Ants and Giant Scorpions.

#### Halflings

The nomadic [Halfling](../character_creation/race/halfling) tribes are not native to the Nameless Desert, but have spent several generations inhabiting it since their exodus from the greenlands. The desert provides a natural barrier against conquest by Elves or Dwarves, and time spent living among the wastes have made Halfling hunters exceptionally skilled. Deadly poisons are now one of their people's primary exports.

#### Djinn

The [Dreamweaver](../character_creation/class/cleric) mystery cult have stories of immortal air spirits who once dwelled within the Nameless Desert. In an age of myths, mortal mages once imprisoned the spirits in magical artifice. Flying carpets, magic rings, and other marvels were fueled by the Djinns' eternal attempts to escape their bindings. No such artifacts are known to exist in the modern era but many wistful adventurers hold out hope.
