# Literati

#### The Bleeding Edge

A community of scholars has taken up residence in the Canvaslands. Despite the inhospitable conditions, many find the intellectual climate to be less stifling than that of their homeland, and enjoy the freedom to publish as their hearts' dictate.

#### Heretics and Disgrace

Correspondingly, most Literati are of ill-repute in civilized lands. There are a number whose crackpot theories have seen them disgraced from well-regarded circles. Others pursue taboo topics, like the closely kept secrets of the mystery cults or the development of dangerous alchemy. No small number are [human](../../character_creation/race/human) dissidents seeking to overturn the world order and free their people from servitude.

#### Anonymity

Literati communicate near exclusively through postage. Members do not know one another's faces, races, or other characteristics. One is known solely by their ideas and their pseudonyms.
