# Mystery Cults

#### Navean Religion

Like their [real world analogues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Roman_mysteries), mystery cults are organizations that fulfill the religious needs of the wider public while reserving higher order secrets for [initiates](../../character_creation/class/cleric). They officiate over important ceremonies like weddings and funerals.

#### Local Cults

There are thousands of cults in Naevis, each with their own beliefs and agendas. Three currently have a presence in the Canvaslands.

* **[Stone Legionnaires](../../more/archetypes/cleric_stone)** are a fraternity of warrior priests who believe in testing themselves against ever-greater trials.
* **[Dreamweavers](../../more/archetypes/cleric_dream)** are occultist mystics who pursue esoteric truths about the world.
* **[Hell Knights](../../more/archetypes/cleric_hell)** are revolutionaries and anarchists, generally unwelcome in settled lands.
* **[Winter Witches](../../more/archetypes/cleric_winter)** are nuns and monks who establish monasteries in remote lands.

#### Divinity

According to ancient myth, the gods came to this realm countless millennia ago. They spoke to all the creatures of the world using spirits of nature as their messengers and sought to pass along the secrets of civilization. Only four races proved themselves worthy to learn agriculture, language, and magic. These races were collectively known as the [Kindred](../../character_creation/race/index), and upon the completion of their instruction, the gods wordlessly departed.

Scholars have long questioned the historical value of the myth. The existence of [City Dwellers](../city_dwellers/index) further cast doubt on the matter, much to the displeasure of many cults. A large subset of the Navean population considers City Dwellers' to be an imaginative [Piper's](../../character_creation/background/piper) tale.
