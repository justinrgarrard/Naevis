# Mystery Cults

#### Navean Religion

Like their [real world analogues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Roman_mysteries), mystery cults are organizations that fulfill the religious needs of the wider public while reserving higher order secrets for [initiates](../../character_creation/class/cleric). They officiate over important ceremonies like weddings and funerals.

#### Local Cults

There are thousands of cults in Naevis, each with their own beliefs and agendas. Four currently have a presence in the Canvaslands.

* **[Stone Legionnaires](../../more/archetypes/cleric_stone)** are a fraternity of warrior priests who believe in testing themselves against ever-greater trials.
* **[Dreamweavers](../../more/archetypes/cleric_dream)** are occultist mystics who pursue esoteric truths about the world.
* **[Hell Knights](../../more/archetypes/cleric_hell)** are revolutionaries and anarchists, generally unwelcome in settled lands.
* **[Winter Maidens](../../more/archetypes/cleric_winter)** are nuns and monks who establish monasteries in remote lands.
