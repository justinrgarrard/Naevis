# Campaigns

#### The Long Haul

Campaigns are longer form games, typically consisting of 10 or more sessions conducted over months of real world time. They allow players to grow their characters and interact with the world more thoroughly than in a oneshot.

#### Episodic Sessions

Campaigns in Naevis are designed to be run as a series of standalone adventures, each self contained. This allows players to drop in or drop out as necessary. It also allows the Game Master to try a number of different concepts throughout the same campaign. Today's dungeon might be an undead infested library, next week's could be a negotiation between two rival orc clans.

> Although not explicitly designed for it, Naevis can be adapted to work with megadungeons. Entire modules can be retrofitted to take place within the City Below. This can be a great way to reduce the amount of prep work required to run games.
