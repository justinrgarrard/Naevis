# Combat

#### Tips

Combat scenarios can be difficult to run for even the most experienced Game Masters. A few guidelines are offered below:

* **Keep it Fast**: Typically, combat should go for no longer than three rounds. A boss fight may go for twice that.

* **Keep it Lethal**: Most [non-boss enemies](mooks) should die in a single hit (1 HP). Conversely, their attacks should deal a flat amount of damage to avoid bogging down fights with excessive dice rolls.

* **Keep it Interesting**: Each encounter should have a "gimmick" of some kind. For instance, a skirmish against Giant Bats might have the bats taking a free disengage on their turns to stay out of melee range.
