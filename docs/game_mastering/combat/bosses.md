# Bosses

Boss fights are more challenging encounters intended to threaten parties. They should be very difficult to win without some form of tactics.

* **Multiple Initiatives**: Bosses attack multiple times each round, spread out between player actions.

* **Scaling Hit Points**: The number of hit points a boss has depends on the number of players participating. A good rule of thumb is (25 + 10 per player).

* **High Lethality**: Boss creatures deal a lot of damage each attack. This reinforces the danger involved, keeps fights short, and encourages players to strategize.

* **Multiple Stages**: Boss creatures change their behavior throughout the fight. They may attempt to surrender at a certain percentage of health, gain more turns each round, or introduce new attacks.

* **Damage Resistance**: Many boss creatures are resistant to non-magical weaponry or have other defenses that make them troublesome to take down.
