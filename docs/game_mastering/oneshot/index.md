# Oneshot

#### An Introduction to Naevis

The first session in this setting should be designed as a standalone oneshot that can be completed within three hours. The goal of this session is to familiarize players with the setting and its basic mechanics.

Your objective, as the Game Master, is to **prioritize momentum.** Keep the game moving at a good pace, gently moving the players forward when they're stuck. The approach detailed here offers a suggestion on how to do so.

#### Setting Expectations

Before rolling any dice, creating any characters, or doing anything else, you must sit down with your players and describe the type of game this supplement is designed to run.

> **Dungeon Crawl**: A tactical, resource-based survival game. Gold, healing, and magic are in limited supply.

It's important that everyone is on board with the type of game being run. If players are expecting a high-octane pulp action game, or a hack-and-slash adventure, frustration may result.
