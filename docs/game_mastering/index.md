# Game Mastering

#### What This Section Is About

The role of running games (called "Dungeon Master", "Game Master", and many other things) is covered widely across many resources. Preliminary information can be found in the [Basic Rules](../more/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf). A [wider collection](recommended_reading) of tips and tricks can be found on dedicated blogs and within officially published material.

This section will not attempt to cover the entirety of Game Mastering know-how. Instead, it will offer a few general tricks to help in evoking the **Survival Adventure** genre.

#### Getting Started

* [The Introductory Oneshot](oneshot/index)

<!-- #### Theme

Players familiar with several D&D settings will recognize that each has its own theme. _Barovia_ trends towards horror fantasy. _Eberron_ is pulp action and noir. The _Forgotten Realms_ are high fantasy. Naevis' theme is **Survival Adventure**. 

* **Low Fantasy**: Magic is a tool, not a panacea. 

* **Tactics**: Fair fights tend to be hard fights.

* **Obstacles**: Many problems cannot be solved through violence.

* **Preparation**: Planning and tooling are crucial for success. -->

<!-- #### The Big Idea

Gameplay in the Naevis setting focuses on **momentum**. The Game Master's role is to help direct the flow of the game, speeding things along when there's a lull and slowing things down when the pace becomes frantic.

#### The Toolbox

Running a game is one part session prep and two parts improvisation. In the same way that players must make use of their character sheets to play, Game Masters must make use of their toolbox to direct play. The contents of one's toolbox include [rooms](), [loot tables](), and [tricks]() at a minimum.

#### Getting Started

Before planning any longer term engagements, an interested group of players should try the oneshot introduction to Naevis.  -->
