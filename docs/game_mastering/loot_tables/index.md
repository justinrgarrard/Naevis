# Loot Tables

#### Randomized Treasure

A loot table is a randomized treasure system. When players stumble on to a treasure trove or cache of valuables, they receive a number of rolls on one of the loot tables.

| Table     | Type         | Recommended Level |
| :-------- | :----------- | :---------------- |
| **Minor** | Low rarity.  | 1-5               |
| **Major** | High rarity. | 6-10              |

> In general, three rolls on the appropriate loot table is the norm for any given session. 

#### Resale Value

The sale value of an item depends on both its rarity and whether or not it's a consumable. Items at the level of _Rare_  or higher cannot be sold. Thieves and assassins may target adventurers in possession of such items.

| Rarity        | Consumable Sale Value | Non-Consumable Sale Value |
| :------------ | :-------------------- | :------------------------ |
| **Common**    | 25 gp                 | 50 gp                     |
| **Uncommon**  | 125 gp                | 250 gp                    |
| **Rare**      | -                     | -                         |
| **Very Rare** | -                     | -                         |
