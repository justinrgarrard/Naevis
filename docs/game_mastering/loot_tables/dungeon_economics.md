# Dungeon Economics

#### The Adventuring Cycle

Typically, a successful expedition should increase a low-level adventurer's net worth by about 55 gp. Realistically, this value will fluctuate quite a bit depending on luck and player ingenuity. A roll on the [minor loot table](loot_tables/minor) has an expected value of ~75 gp.

* A **70%** chance of being worth **25 gp** (potion or scroll).
* A **15%** chance of being worth **125 gp** (Elemental Crystal).
* A **15%** of being worth **250 gp** (Sentient Weapon).

\* _Average loot assumes one Backpack of Loot and a single roll on the minor loot table for a given player._

#### Optimizing Profits

Clever players may begin to optimize on the basic calculation. They may become more ambitious in acquiring loot, incorporate crafting to reduce costs, or follow other routes to maximize profits. **This is expected and intentional.**

One of the goals of this setting is to get players thinking about their inventory. Present high-risk, high-rewards [rooms](../oneshot/rooms) and watch the gears turn in their heads. Let them debate whether or not to use a valuable healing potion in a hard fight. Present a 100 lb. object worth 100 gp at the bottom of a cliff and let them brainstorm how to get it out of the dungeon.

Gold, like level-ups, should be a motivating resource that gets players involved in the game.


#### Let the Gold Flow

Don't be overly stingy with handing out rewards. Let the players find an unexpected windfall from time to time. Even if they stock up on potions and scrolls, random chance has a way of balancing things out.
