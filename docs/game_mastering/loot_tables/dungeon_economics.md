# Dungeon Economics

#### The Adventuring Cycle

{: .note}
> **The Basic Calculation**
> 
> * One Bag of Loot per Session = 50 gp
>
> * Avg. One Common Magic Item (Consumable) per Session = 25 gp
>
> * Downtime Tax per Session = -20 gp
>
> * Profit per Session = 55 gp

At a minimum, a successful expedition should increase a low-level adventurer's net worth by 55 gp. This is approximately equal to a single spell scroll, potion of healing, or other item.


#### Optimizing Profits

Clever players may begin to optimize on the basic calculation. They may bring extra backpacks for treasure, become more ambitious in acquiring loot, incorporate crafting to reduce costs, or follow other routes to maximize profits. **This is expected and intentional.**

One of the goals of this setting is to get players thinking about their inventory. Present high-risk, high-rewards [rooms](../oneshot/rooms) and watch the gears turn in their heads. Let them debate whether or not to use a valuable healing potion in a hard fight. Present a 100 lb. object worth 100 gp at the bottom of a cliff and let them brainstorm how to get it out of the dungeon.

Gold, like level-ups, should be a motivating resource that gets players involved in the game.


#### Let the Gold Flow

Don't be overly stingy with handing out rewards. Let the players find an unexpected windfall from time to time. Even if they stock up on potions and scrolls, random chance has a way of balancing things out.
