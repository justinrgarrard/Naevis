#### Descriptions

{: .mundane-item}
> **Dust of Disappearance**
>
> *Wondrous item, uncommon, 1 lb.*
>
> Found in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within 10 feet of you become invisible for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility ends for that creature.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Elemental Gem**
>
> *Wondrous item, uncommon, 1 lb.*
>
> This gem contains a mote of elemental energy. When you use an action to break the gem, an elemental is summoned as if you had cast the conjure elemental spell, and the gem's magic is lost. The type of gem determines the elemental summoned by the spell.
> 
> * **Blue Sapphire**: 	Air Elemental
> * **Yellow Diamond**: 	Earth Elemental
> * **Red Corundum**: 	Fire Elemental
> * **Emerald**: 	Water Elemental

{: .mundane-item}
> **Immovable Rod**
>
> *Rod, uncommon, 1 lb.*
>
> This flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use an action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an action to push the button again, the rod doesn't move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Crystal of Commanding Elementals**
>
> *Wondrous item, rare, 5 lb.*
>
> When blood is shed on this crystal, you can use an action to speak its command word and summon an elemental, as if you had cast the conjure elemental spell. The crystal can’t be used this way again until the next dawn. The type of crystal determines the elemental summoned by the spell.
> 
> * **Blue Sapphire**: 	Air Elemental
> * **Yellow Diamond**: 	Earth Elemental
> * **Red Corundum**: 	Fire Elemental
> * **Emerald**: 	Water Elemental

{: .mundane-item}
> **Ring of Evasion**
>
> *Wondrous item, rare, 1 lb.*
>
> This ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw while wearing it, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of its charges to succeed on that saving throw instead.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Cloak of Arachnida**
>
> *Wondrous item, uncommon, 1 lb.*
>
> This fine garment is made of black silk interwoven with faint silvery threads. While wearing it, you gain the following benefits: 
> * You have resistance to poison damage. 
> * You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. 
> * You can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. 
> * You can’t be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as if they were difficult terrain. 
> * You can use an action to cast the web spell (save DC 13). The web created by the spell fills twice its normal area. Once used, this property of the cloak can’t be used again until the next dawn.
