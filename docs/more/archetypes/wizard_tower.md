# Wizard: Tower Mage

_Tower Mages are recluses that practice their arts away from civilization, developing a particular talent for scroll scribing. Among their number are researchers, necromancers, and enchanters._


#### Deep Reserves

When you take this archetype at 2nd level, you gain an additional use of Arcane Recovery.


#### Transmute Scroll

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to improvise spell scrolls. As an action, you expend a use of Arcane Recovery to magically duplicate one of the spells in your spellbook. The duplicate must be placed within a blank piece of paper and functions identically to a spell scroll. The chosen spell must be of a level that you would otherwise recover using Arcane Recovery, and is cast at the lowest possible level. If the scroll is not used within 24 hours, it crumbles to dust.


#### Scroll Arts

At 6th level, when you cast a spell from a scroll, you can enhance it in one of the following ways:

* **Distant**: If the spell has a range of 5 feet or more, the range doubles.
* **Extend**: If the spell has a duration of one round or longer, the duration of the spell doubles, to a maximum of 24 hours.
* **Empower**: If the spell deals damage, you can reroll a number of damage dice equal to the scroll's spell level and take the new result.


#### Read Magic

Beginning at 10th level, you can use scrolls outside your spell list, but cannot add them to your spellbook.


#### Doublecast

At 14th level, if you use your action to cast a spell, you can use your bonus action to cast a second spell from a scroll, provided that the second spell has a casting time of one action and a spell level of three or lower. You must take a short or long rest before using this feature again.
