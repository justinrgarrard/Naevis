# Fighter: Warprince

_The Windblade martial art is a popular fighting style among Navean officers. Derived from Elven sword and bow techniques, users make heavy use of momentum to wield their weapons with unusual grace. Blademasters, sharpshooters, and professional duelists are typical users._


#### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in acrobatics. 


#### Leap
Starting at 3rd level, your high jump distance increases to 10 feet and your long jump distance increases to 20 feet.


#### Aura Stance
At 3rd level, you have masted a set of techniques that enhance your use of weapons. Using a bonus action, you can gain the benefits of a stance until the start of your next turn.

* **Sky Piercing Stance**: Melee weapons you wield gain the _Reach_ tag. Ranged weapons you wield are not penalized for attacks made at long range.

* **Windstorm Stance**: Weapons you wield are not affected by the _Heavy_ or _Two Handed_ tags. If a weapon has neither tag, it instead gains the _Finesse_ property. 

* **Dust Devil Stance**: You activate two-weapon fighting when you adopt this stance, making an attack against a creature. You can use two-weapon fighting even when the melee weapons you are using aren't light. 


#### Counter
Starting at 7th level, after an enemy makes a melee attack against you, you can expend your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against them. Additionally, your proficiency bonus for Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks is doubled.


#### Wind Cutter
At 10th level, you've extended your mastery over wind techniques. You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures in a 15-foot cone in front of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. 


#### Whirlwind
Starting at 15th level, you can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.


#### Dauntless
At 18th level, if you have no uses of Action Surge when rolling initiative, you regain one expended use.
