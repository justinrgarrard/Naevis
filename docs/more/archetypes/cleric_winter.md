# Cleric: Winter Priest

_To some, winter is a time of hunger and desperation. To others, it is a period of rest and reflection. Clerics of this domain embody both aspects as intermediaries of the divine. Their cult is known to found monasteries in isolated places where initiates can focus on meditation._

#### Winter's Touch 

At 1st level, you learn the *Ray of Frost* cantrip and gain proficiency with the [Primordial](../languages/secret_languages) language.


#### Diamond Dust

At 1st level, you can call on the power of winter to raise a cloud of icy fog. You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within 100 feet of you. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for ten minutes or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. You must take a short or long rest before using this feature again.


#### Channel Divinity: Winter's Heart

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to plummet the temperature nearby. As an action, you can present your holy symbol. All creatures within 100 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell DC or have their movement set to 0 until the start of your next turn. Creatures that pass the save have their movement speed halved instead. Any water or other liquid in the area freezes into a thin sheet of ice.


#### Frostbite

At 6th level, your _Ray of Frost_ cantrip improves. When you cast it, you can split the attack into multiple beams. Two at this level, three at 11th level, and four at 17th level. Make a separate attack roll for each beam. Each does 1d8 damage and reduces the target's movement by 20 feet instead of 10.


#### Potent Spellcasting

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.


#### Winter's Emissary

At 17th level, you embody winter itself. You gain immunity to cold damage and resistance to fire damage.
