# Rogue: Knife Dancer

_The practice of throwing knives is common to many martial and performance arts. Those who specialize in the discipline find their talents well-suited to the adventuring life. Assassins, grenadiers, and hunters have been known to follow this tradition._


#### Practiced Hands
Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to take the **Use an Object** action or make a ranged throwing attack, drawing the weapon as part of the attack. Additionally, you gain proficiency with improvised thrown weapons, and can accurately throw them up to 60 feet without penalty.


#### Hammertoss
At 3rd level, you no longer receive a penalty for making long range attacks with thrown weapons. When you make a ranged throwing weapon attack within 20 feet of the target, you gain a +2 bonus to the attack roll.


#### Extra Attack
Starting at 9th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

<!-- #### Return Fire
Starting at 9th level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your rogue level. If the remaining damage is more than you would take from using Uncanny Dodge, you use Uncanny Dodge instead.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can make a ranged attack with a range of 20/60 using the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies. -->


#### Fan of Knives
Ay 13th level, you can use your action to make a ranged throwing attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon’s range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.


#### Thief’s Reflexes
When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature when you are surprised.
