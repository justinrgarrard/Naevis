#### Channel Divinity: Lesser Wall of Stone

At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create fortifications. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and create a 3-inch thick 5-foot-by-5-foot panel of stone within five feet of where you're standing. The stone must be drawn out of an earthen material, such as mud or dirt.


#### Divine Strikes

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.


#### One with Stone
