#### Reflavoring Archetypes

Archetypes from outside the _Basic Rules_ may require customization for use in this setting. Some, like the Rune Knight, may involve too much magic for a low-fantasy setting. Others (such as Cleric domains) may provide spells that aren't included in the _Basic Rules_.

If you would like to use an external archetype, work with your GM to modify it appropriately.
