# Adapting Archetypes

Archetypes from outside the _Basic Rules_ may require customization for use in this setting. Some, like the Echo Knight, may involve too much magic for a low-fantasy setting. Others (such as Cleric domains) may provide spells that aren't included in the _Basic Rules_. Work with your Game Master to adjust or reflavor features as necessary.

**Keep in mind that the GM can veto an archetype.**


{: .note}
> **Guidelines**
> 
> * **Replace Spells** that do not exist in the _Basic Rules_ with those that do, particularly for Cleric domains.
> 
> * **Reflavor Magical Effects** as martial techniques or feats of skill.
> 
> * **Provide Context** for where your abilities come from in this setting.
