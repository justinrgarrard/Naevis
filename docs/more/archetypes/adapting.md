# Adapting Archetypes

Archetypes from outside the _Basic Rules_ may require customization for use in this setting. Some, like the Echo Knight, may involve too much magic for a low-fantasy setting. Others may provide spells that aren't included in the _Basic Rules_. Work with your Game Master to adjust or reflavor features as necessary.

**Keep in mind that the GM can veto an archetype.**


{: .note}
> **Guidelines**
> 
> * **Replace Spells** that do not exist in the _Basic Rules_ with those that do.
> 
> * **Reflavor Magical Effects** as martial techniques or feats of skill.
> 
> * **Provide Context** for where your abilities come from in this setting.


#### Example: War Domain

The Cleric War domain can be repurposed with minor changes to its spell list. Note that the replacement spells have a theme close to their originals. Should the player wish, they might add the [Giant](../languages/secret#secret-languages) secret language to starting proficiencies for roleplaying effect.

| Cleric Level |                                 Spells |
| :----------- | -------------------------------------: |
| 1st          |     ***Cure Wounds***, Shield of Faith |
| 3rd          |         Magic Weapon, Spiritual Weapon |
| 5th          | ***Beacon of Hope***, Spirit Guardians |
| 7th          |         Freedom of Movement, Stoneskin |
| 9th          |             Flame Strike, Hold Monster |


#### Example: Rune Knight

The Fighter Rune Knight subclass has more magic than the setting typically allows for. Removing the size increase from *Giant's Might* may be sufficient, though some abilities (such as the fire shackles conjured by *Fire Rune*) could also be reflavored. 

#### Example: Divination Wizard

The Wizard Divination subclass has an expectation of more spells than the _Basic Rules_ possesses. Because of this, the sixth level class feature is not usable, and will need to be replaced. A suggested alternative is shown below.

**Divination Mastery**

> When you cast a first level divination spell as a ritual, the casting time is instant.
