# Secret Languages

#### Words of Power

Secret languages have magical properties that many adventurers find useful. Though supernatural, they are fundamentally distinct from spells, and do not require spellcasting to use.

> **Abyssal (Undead)**, the secret language of the dead. All who pass from this world to the next lose knowledge of mortal tongues. Those who return speak and understand only Abyssal. Proficiency allows one to speak with undead, even catching the attention of barely aware ilk like zombies and skeletons.

> **Celestial (Truth)**, the secret language of the long departed gods. An unseen force prevents any from knowingly speaking lies in this tongue. Proficiency allows one to swear binding oaths which curse the speaker when broken.

> **Deep Speech (Telepathy)**, the secret language of silent monks. A strange art that allows one to communicate wordlessly and directly to the mind. Proficiency allows one to send flashes of emotions or images to a creature within arm's reach.

> **Primordial (Farspeech)**, the secret language of the mythical djinn. Words whispered in this language are gently carried by the wind to their recipient. Proficiency allows one to speak to others up to five miles away, though if the recipient isn't proficient, they hear a rattle of indistinguishable whispers.

> **Sylvan (Beast Speech)**, the secret language of nature spirits. Legend holds that they once served the gods as divine messengers, but fell silent when the gods departed. Proficiency allows one to speak to beasts, conveying the speaker's intent to animals. It does not allow the speaker to understand beasts, nor command them.
