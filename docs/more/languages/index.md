# Languages

{: .language}
> **Common**, the human tongue, is widely used as the language of trade and diplomacy. All adventurers are proficient in Common, but most City Dwellers are not.

#### Cultural Barriers

[Kindred](../../character_creation/race/index) and [City Dwellers](../../the_frontier/city_dwellers/index) do not share a common language. Adventurers wishing to communicate with them will need to study either [Undercommon or Infernal](racial#city-dweller-languages).

#### Magic

Spellcasting is based off of [secret languages](secret). All wizards utilize [Draconic](secret#draconic) for their spellcraft, while clerics make use of their cult's specific language. 

#### Signals

Soldiers, hunters, burglars, and black market dealers are known to communicate through [Cant](cant), a combination sign and signal language.
