# Cant

#### Hand Signs and Signals

{: .language}
> **Cant** is a sign and signal language. Being proficient in this language allows you to purchase dangerous items like poison and grenades. [Rogues](../../character_creation/class/rogue) gain this language for free at first level.

Cant shares much in common with real-world [visual signal](https://www.moore.army.mil/infantry/DoctrineSupplement/ATP3-21.8/PDFs/fm21_60.pdf) languages. It encompasses hand signs, semaphore, and a variation of morse code. It can be used to communicate silently and to send messages over longer distances.

#### Dialects

Variations of Cant exist between different professions. The hand sign for "law enforcement" in *Thieves' Cant* might translate to "enemy force" in *Soldiers' Cant*, or "dangerous beast" in *Hunters' Cant*. Communication is generally not hampered despite these differences.

#### Black Markets

Cant allows users to silently signal a request for illicit goods to shopkeepers. If the merchant is in the know and receptive, they will return an innocuous gesture confirming the request.
