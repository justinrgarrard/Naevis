# Secret Languages

#### Words of Power

Secret languages are languages of [magic](../../the_frontier/greenlands/magic), capable of producing supernatural effects without the use of spells. 

##### **Abyssal**

{: .exotic-language}
> **Abyssal (Undead)**
> 
> The secret language of the dead. All who pass from this world to the next lose knowledge of mortal tongues. Those who return from the afterlife are only capable of speaking and understanding Abyssal. Proficiency allows the user to communicate with undead, even commanding the attention of barely aware creatures like zombies or skeletons. [Hell Knights](../../../archetypes/cleric_hell) and ancient necromancers use this language when casting spells.

##### **Deep Speech**

{: .exotic-language}
> **Deep Speech (Telepathy)**
> 
> The secret language of psychics. An esoteric art that allows one to touch the minds of others. Proficiency allows the user to send emotions or images to a creature up to 30 feet away. Additionally, they can sense the emotions of living creatures within that same range using a Wisdom (Insight) check. [Dreamweavers](../../../archetypes/cleric_dream) use this language when casting spells.

##### **Giant**

{: .exotic-language}
> **Giant (Runes)**
> 
> The secret language of a long extinct race. Proficiency in this language teaches the two fundamental runes. Carving "steadfast" into a door or weapon makes it harder to break. Tying a knot in the shape of "holdfast" makes it less likely to fray, while etching it into a lock makes it harder to pick. [Stone Legionnaires](../../../archetypes/cleric_stone) use this language when casting spells.

##### **Sylvan**

{: .exotic-language}
> **Sylvan (Beast Speech)**
> 
> The secret language of nature spirits. Legend holds that they once served the gods as divine messengers, but fell silent when the gods departed. Proficiency allows the user to speak to and understand beasts. Whether or not the beasts choose to listen is a different matter, often influenced by a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. [Winter Witches](../../../archetypes/cleric_winter) use this language when casting spells.

#### **Draconic**

The secret language of [wizardry](../../character_creation/class/wizard). Arcane spells with a verbal component use this language, as do most spell scrolls.  Unlike other secret languages, it has no innate magical properties, and can only be learned by taking a level in the Wizard class.

<!-- Draconic has no innate magical properties. Unlike other secret languages, it is artificial, having been supposedly created by the founder of the [Elven Empire](../../the_frontier/greenlands/elves). It is considered the most versatile secret language, able to produce the largest variety of spells and scrolls. Much of a wizards preliminary training is in acquiring fluency. -->
