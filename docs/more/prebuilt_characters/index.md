# Prebuilt Characters

#### Standard

* [Dwarven Cleric](dwarven_cleric)
* [Human Fighter](human_fighter)
* [Halfing Rogue](halfling_rogue)

#### Multiclass

Some classes from outside the _Basic Rules_ can be approximated through multiclassing. [Variant Humans](../../character_creation/race/human) can take the requisite [feat](../feats/multiclassing) at level one. A few level one concepts are shown below.
