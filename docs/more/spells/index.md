# Spells

Transcription of spell lists from the _Basic Rules_.

<!-- #### Shaping Energies

Spells are magical effects that certain trained adventurers can use. 

* For [Wizards](../../character_creation/class/wizard), spells are drawn from ambient magic energy and cast using the [Draconic](../../more/languages/secret_languages#draconic) language.

* For [Clerics](../../character_creation/class/cleric), spells are drawn from their cult's particular source (such as psychic energy or spirits of the land) and cast using their cult's [secret language](../../more/languages/secret_languages).

> **Review: Components**
>
> A spell can have up to three components: verbal, somatic, and material.
>
> Spells with a verbal component require the ability to speak. Spells with a somatic component require a gesture and free hands. Spells with a material component require a [wand or holy symbol](../../gear/adventuring_gear/spellcasting_equipment), or in some instances a specific item (i.e. a pearl for _Identify_). -->
