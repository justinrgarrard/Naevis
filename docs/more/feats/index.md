# Feats

Feats are the result of training in disciplines outside of one's own class. Adventurers can choose between taking a feat or an ability score increase at level 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20. Fighters gain bonus feats at levels 6 and 14.

#### Multiclassing

Multiclassing in Naevis is handled through [specialized feats](multiclassing). Adventurers must take a multiclassing feat **before** taking the first level of a new class.
