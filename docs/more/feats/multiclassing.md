# Multiclassing Feats

{: .note}
> **Multiclassing**
>
> Multiclassing is not covered in the _[Basic Rules]()_. Instead, the feat-based mechanic described in this section can be used.

#### How It Works

Characters must take the necessary multiclassing feat before they can take their first level in a new class. A feat's benefits will become redundant after the first level of the new class is taken. A character does not have to multiclass after taking a feat; they can treat the feat as they would any other feat.

#### Spellcasting

If a class provides spellcasting, it **does not** stack with any other class' spellcasting progression. The two progress separately and have different pools of spell slots.


{: .feat}
> **Multiclass: Cleric**
>
> *Requirements: Wisdom 13, Not a Cleric*
> 
> You learn three Cleric cantrips. 
>
> When you next level up, you can choose to gain a level in Cleric. Doing so provides all the benefits that a first level Cleric would receive, except skills and cantrips.

>
> *Requirements: Strength 13, Not a Fighter*

>
> When you next level up, you can choose to gain a level in Fighter. Doing so provides all the benefits that a first level Fighter would receive, except skills.

>
> *Requirements: Dexterity 13, Not a Rogue*
> 
> You gain proficiency with two skills and either thieves' tools or [cant](../../more/languages/index).

>
> *Requirements: Intelligence 13, Not a Wizard*
