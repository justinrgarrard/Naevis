# Multiclassing Feats

#### How It Works

* **Prerequisite**: Characters must take the necessary multiclassing feat ***before*** they can take their first level in a new class.

* **Standalone**: A character does not have to multiclass if they take a multiclass feat. 

* **Redundancy**: A feat's benefits are replaced by the class' benefits once the first level of the new class is taken.

* **Benefits**: Characters gain all the proficiencies that a new class would provide at level 1. These include proficiencies for skills, equipment, and ability saves.

* **Spellcasting**: If a class provides spellcasting, it does not stack with any other class' spellcasting progression. The two are treated as having separate pools of spell slots.
