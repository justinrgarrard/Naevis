# Character Creation

<!-- ### Naevean Heroes

Adventurers in the Naevis are survivalists, equally adept at fighting and fieldcraft. When creating a Naevis character, keep in mind that **encumbrance**, **lighting**, and **no long rests** are important factors. -->

#### Quickstart

Players can choose one of the [prebuilt characters](../more/prebuilt_characters/index) to quickly begin play.

#### Standard

New characters can be rolled up using the process detailed in the _[Basic Rules](../more/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf)_, with minor differences in picking backgrounds and starting equipment.

1. Choose a [Class](class/index).
2. Choose a [Race](race/index).
3. Choose a [Background](background/index).
4. Determine [Ability Scores](ability_scores).
5. (Optional) Customize [Starting Equipment](../gear/starting_equipment/).
