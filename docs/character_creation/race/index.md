# Race

{: .note }
> **Non-Basic Races**
> 
> Races outside the four provided in the _[Basic Rules](docs/more/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf)_ are not supported by this setting, but can be used with the Game Master's permission.

#### Kindred

* **[Elves](elf)** are the longest lived race, and the most influential. The Elven Empire is the dominant force in Naevis.
* **[Dwarves](dwarf)** are second in the global order. They contest Elven hegemony from their mountainous city-states.
* **[Halflings](halfling)** are tribal nomads that live in caravans. They are skilled merchants, hunters, and warriors.
* **[Humans](human)** make up the lower classes of Elven and Dwarven nations. Their kingdom exist solely at the mercy of the two great powers.

#### City Dwellers

A number of [intelligent races](../../the_frontier/city_dwellers/index) have been discovered in the City Below. These creatures are capable of speech, magic, and trade. However, they do not share a [language](../../more/languages/index) with the Kindred and are typically hostile to outsiders.

> **Optional Rule: Playing a City Dweller**
>
> Should the Game Master allow other races, players might roleplay their characters as being native to the City Below. The existing [backgrounds](../background/index) can be adapted appropriately; ambassadors from underground nations, clan exiles, and curious scholars might find their way up to the Canvaslands.
