# Race

{: .note }
> **Non-Basic Races**
> 
> Races outside the four provided in the _[Basic Rules](docs/more/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf)_ are not supported by this setting, but can be used with the Game Master's permission.

#### The Kindred

* **[Elves](elf)** are the longest lived race, and the most influential. The Elven Empire is the dominant force in Naevis.
* **[Dwarves](dwarf)** are second in the global order. They contest Elven hegemony from their mountainous city-states.
* **[Humans](human)** are a subservient race, largely enslaved by the Elves and Dwarves. Their kingdoms are puppeted by the longer lived races.
* **[Halflings](halfling)** are tribal nomads that live in caravans apart from the other races. They are skilled merchants, hunters, and warriors.

#### City Dwellers

A number of [intelligent races](../../the_frontier/city_dwellers/index) have been discovered in the City Below. These creatures are capable of speech, magic, and trade. However, they do not share a [language](../../more/languages/index) with the Kindred and are typically hostile to outsiders.

<!-- #### Subrace as Culture

A character's "race" reflects their species, while "subrace" describes their social caste.

For example, High Elves are born to noble bloodlines among their people. They receive comprehensive educations that include spellcraft and language arts, and this upbringing is reflected in their subrace traits.

Wood Elves are physically indistinguishable from High Elves but are born to insignificant lineages. Their upbringing entails a compulsory military service which is manifest in their subraces' higher movement speed, stealth, and perceptiveness. -->

<!-- #### Heritage

Naevis is a land where circumstances of birth strongly influence the trajectory of an individual's life. For many, adventuring is the only way to escape their destined lives as workers, nobles, or slaves.

| **Elven Empire**        | Elves are the longest lived race, and most influential. The Elven Empire rules much of the known world.                                              |
| **Dwarven City States** | Dwarves are the second longest lived race. Their City States provide the sole opposition to the Elven Empire.                                        |
| **Halfling Caravans**   | Halflings are a nomadic people that live in winding caravans. They have no homeland, surviving through trade and mercenary work.                     |
| **Human Kingdoms**      | Humans are the misfortunate vassals of elves and dwarves. They live in kingdoms puppeted by the longer lived races, pawns in their ancient wargames. | -->
