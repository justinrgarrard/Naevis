# Human

Humans live as the vassals of either dwarves or elves in small buffer kingdoms between the two global powers. Their lot in life is one of servitude. The kings of men are pawns of longer lived races, and their armies are little more than game pieces.

As individuals, humans struggle to compete with older, wealthier, and more worldly races. Their singular advantage is a peerless capacity for learning. Where it might take an elf or a dwarf fifty years to become a proficient mage, a human can manage in a mere twenty.

Standard humans represent the typical example of their race. Hardy and adaptable, they can excel in any field as jacks-of-all-trades. Most have an innate affinity for a secret language.

Variant humans trade a balanced approach for a highly specialized path. Spellswords, holy knights, and other cross-disciplinary vocations are drawn almost solely from this population.
