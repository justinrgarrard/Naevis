# Wizard

[Wizards](../../more/classes/wizard) are adventurers trained in the academic practice of arcane spellcasting. They are, by necessity, highly educated individuals. 

#### Scrolls
A practitioner is valued as much for their ability to use [scrolls](../../gear/scrolls) as for their individual talents. Fortifications regularly stockpiles caches of scrolls to arm warmages, allowing them to wreak havoc on invaders. 

#### Arcane Magic
Arcane magic, unlike divine magic, is akin to technology. Users draw ambient magic from ley lines under the earth using a wand or similar implement.
