# Wizard

**Wizards** are those adventurers trained in the academic practice of arcane spellcasting. They are, by necessity, highly educated individuals. 

#### Scrolls
A practitioner is valued as much for their ability to use [scrolls](../../gear/scrolls) as for their individual talents. Fortifications regularly stockpiles caches of scrolls to arm war mages, allowing them to wreak havoc on invaders. 

#### Arcane Magic
Arcane magic, unlike divine magic, is akin to technology. Users draw ambient magic from any available source using a wand or similar implement. The verbal components of their spells apply the [Draconic](../../more/languages/secret_languages#draconic) language to channel gathered energy into a useful shape.


### Starting Gear

_Wizard's Pack (25 lb.)_ or 100 gp.

#### Occupations
In Navean societies, practitioners of arcane magic are considered skilled professionals with a similar standing to doctors and lawyers. They are broadly divided into [Court Mages](../../more/archetypes/wizard_court), who intermingle with others, and [Tower Mages](../../more/archetypes/wizard_tower), who do not. The former find employment as shopkeepers, teachers, and civil officials. The latter opt for solitary work as enchanters, alchemists, and scribes.  -->

<!-- #### Arcane Magic
The fundamentals of magic require a firm understanding of mathematics, grammar, and rhetoric before even the barest cantrip can be mustered. The majority of practitioners will never reach beyond [first level spells](../../more/spells/wizard_spells), finding that basic spellcasting is sufficient for most professions. -->

<!-- #### Scroll-Users
Mages make use of [scrolls](../../gear/scrolls) to supplement their limited spells per day. Those in the Canvaslands can scribe new scrolls during [downtime](../../the_city_below/downtime/index) or purchase first level scrolls for 50 gp each.  -->
