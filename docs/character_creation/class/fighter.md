# Fighters

**Fighters** tend to be drawn from the ranks of sellswords and mercenaries. Individuals that merit membership in this class are distinguished warriors known for their combat prowess.

#### Occupations
Fighters come from the martial professions. Soldiers, knights, hunters, thugs, archers, templars... any vocation based principally on violence has overlap with this class.

#### Martial Arts
Skill at arms is the bare minimum requirement for one to be a fighter. Typically, a warrior will adopt or adapt a system of fighting from one of the many martial arts traditions in Naevis. Two of the most common are the [Wind Blade Style](../../more/archetypes/fighter_warprince) and the [Iron Spiral Style](../../more/archetypes/fighter_lionheart).

#### Honor
One's reputation and history of service take on a force of their own, though it need not be positive. Renegades and black knights may find their names equally compelling for different reasons. **When you use your reputation as a warrior, you may make a Strength (Persuasion) or Strength (Intimidation) check.**
