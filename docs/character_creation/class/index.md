<!-- #### Classifications

An adventurer's class is, as the name suggests, a classification. It broadly represents what capacities they bring to a party. A traveling illusionist, an armored spellsword, and a village witch all fall under the classification of "wizard".  -->

#### The Four Classes

* **Clerics** are members of Navean cults, each with their own set of teachings and beliefs.
* **Fighters** are peerless warriors taking their first steps towards mastery of a martial art.
* **Rogues** are specialists with many talents, including knowledge of [cant](../../more/languages/index).
* **Wizards** are trained arcanists with mastery over scrolls and rituals.

#### Multiclassing

Multiclassing is done through the use of [feats](../../more/feats/multiclassing). Humans are the only race that can multiclass before level 5.
