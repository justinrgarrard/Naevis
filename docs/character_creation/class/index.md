> **Non-Basic Classes**
> 
> Classes outside the four provided in the _[Basic Rules](docs/more/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf)_ are not supported by this setting, but can be used with the Game Master's permission.

#### Archetypes

Archetypes are restricted to the four [options](../../more/archetypes/index) available from the _Basic Rules_ by default. A small number of [setting-specific](../../more/archetypes/adapting) and [external](../../more/archetypes/adapting#drop-in) archetypes may be used instead with Game Master approval.

#### Multiclassing

Multiclassing is done through the use of [feats](../../more/feats/multiclassing). Humans are the only race that can multiclass before level 5. Examples can be found [here](../../more/prebuilt_characters/index).
