<!-- #### Classifications

An adventurer's class is, as the name suggests, a classification. It broadly represents what capacities they bring to a party. A traveling illusionist, an armored spellsword, and a village witch all fall under the classification of "wizard".  -->

#### The Four Classes

* **[Clerics](cleric)** are members of Navean cults, each with their own set of teachings and beliefs.
* **[Fighters](fighter)** are peerless warriors and martial arts practitioners.
* **[Rogues](rogue)** are specialists with many talents, including knowledge of [cant](../../more/languages/index).
* **[Wizards](wizard)** are trained arcanists with mastery over scrolls and rituals.

#### Archetypes

Specializations for each class are unlocked at different levels. Players have three options:

* **Basic Rules**: Use the archetype from the _Basic Rules_ for the class.
* **Setting-Specific**: Use one of the [archetypes](../../more/archetypes/index#naevis-archetypes) written for Naevis.
* **Propose**: [Request](../../more/archetypes/index#reflavoring-archetypes) a different archetype, such as one published in the _Player's Handbook_ or other source.

#### Multiclassing

Multiclassing is done through the use of [feats](../../more/feats/multiclassing). Humans are the only race that can multiclass before level 5.
