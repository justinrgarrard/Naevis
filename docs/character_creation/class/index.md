# Class

{: .note }
> **Non-Basic Classes**
> 
> Classes outside the four provided in the _[Basic Rules](docs/more/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf)_ are not supported by this setting, but can be used with the Game Master's permission.


<!-- #### Classifications

An adventurer's class is, as the name suggests, a classification. It broadly represents what capacities they bring to a party. A traveling illusionist, an armored spellsword, and a village witch all fall under the classification of "wizard".  -->

#### The Four Classes

* **[Clerics](cleric)** are members of Navean cults, each with their own set of teachings and beliefs.
* **[Fighters](fighter)** are peerless warriors and martial arts practitioners.
* **[Rogues](rogue)** are specialists with many talents, including knowledge of [cant](../../more/languages/cant).
* **[Wizards](wizard)** are trained arcanists with mastery over scrolls and rituals.

#### Archetypes

[Archetypes](../../more/archetypes/index) are restricted to the four available from the _Basic Rules_ by default. A small number of [external archetypes](../../more/archetypes/adapting#drop-in) are approved for drop-in use, as are a handful of [setting-specific](../../more/archetypes/adapting) archetypes. Players can work with their Game Master to adapt and reflavor other archetypes as needed.

#### Multiclassing

Multiclassing is done through the use of [feats](../../more/feats/multiclassing). Humans are the only race that can multiclass before level 5.
