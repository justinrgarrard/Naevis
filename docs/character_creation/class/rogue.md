# Rogue

**Rogues** are the subtler counterpart to Fighters. Not quite as brawny, they make up for their lesser combat talents with a broader base of aptitudes. 

#### Roguecraft
Even a modest rogue can boast six different skills and two areas of expertise. They are universally proficient in the [Cant](../../more/languages/cant) sign language as well as a small collection of hand tools for picking locks.

#### Diverse Occupations
While rogues are commonly associated with thieves, the class represents a wide variety of different vocations. Archaeologists, sherpas, courtiers, and many others may fall under the category as "versatile specialists".

#### Occupations 
Rogues are perhaps the most diverse class. Many thieves are rogues, as are tacticians and scouts. Sherpas are typically rogues specialized in outdoorsmanship. Scholars may be rogues specialized in a field of study, while talented courtiers are rogues with a focus in persuasion.

#### Tricks of the Trade
Given the difficulty of surviving in the [City Below](../../adventuring/the_city_below/index), local rogues tend towards specializations that improve their chances of survival. [Delvers](../../more/archetypes/rogue_delver) cultivate familiarity with magic scrolls and other useful tools. [Knife Dancers](../../more/archetypes/rogue_knife) take a more martial approach by honing their ability to throw knives and alchemical weapons. -->
