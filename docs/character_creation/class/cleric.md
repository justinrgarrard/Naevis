# Cleric

**Clerics** are initiates into one of Naevis' many mystery cults. As part of their induction, they undergo a ritual that kindles their magic. 

{: .note}
> Clerics are the only one of the four base classes that much choose an [**archetype**](../../more/archetypes/index) at first level.

#### Mystery Cults

Religion in Naevis is organized across [countless organizations](../../the_frontier/canvaslands/mystery_cults), each with their own particular beliefs and rituals. Similar to their [real world analogues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Roman_mysteries) in ancient Greece, mystery cult initiates are sworn to secrecy regarding their religion's deeper truths.

#### Divine Magic

Navean clerics draw their power from a source specific to their cult rather than a deity. A nature-oriented cleric might pull power from the land, while a mental-oriented cleric might use psychic energy. Once gathered, a cleric casts a spell through intuition rather than rote practice.

<!-- #### Occupations

Clerics have highly variable relationships with their communities. Some live in monasteries as reclusive spiritualists. Others serve as priests who officiate over weddings, harvest festivals, and funerals. Hermits are common, as are warrior priests employed by mercenary outfits. -->

<!-- #### The Rites of Induction

Navean clerics are no longer fully mortal after their initiation. The spark of divine magic is kindled within them and their physical appearance is marked in a manner that indicates their cult affiliation. Many [Hell Knights](../../more/archetypes/cleric_hell), for example, have eyes that glow with firelight.

A universal side-effect of initiation is the inability to have children. As a consequence of this, clerics are largely disbarred from the lines of succession of noble families. -->
