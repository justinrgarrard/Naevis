# Cleric

[Clerics](../../more/classes/cleric) are initiates into one of Naevis' many mystery cults. As part of their induction, they undergo a ritual that kindles their magic. 

{: .note}
> Clerics are the only one of the four base classes that much choose an [**archetype**](../../more/archetypes/index) at first level.

#### Mystery Cults

Religion in Naevis is organized across [countless organizations](../../the_frontier/canvaslands/mystery_cults), each with their own particular beliefs and rituals. Similar to their [real world analogues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Roman_mysteries), initiates are sworn to secrecy regarding their faith's deeper truths. Many are also physically changed by the rites of initiation, acquiring unusual physical characteristics such as faintly glowing eyes or elongated canines.

#### Divine Magic

Navean clerics draw their power from a source specific to their cult. A nature-oriented cleric might pull power from the land, while a mental-oriented cleric might use psychic energy.
