# Rest

#### The Adventuring Day

In a typical session, adventurers can expect to take **one to three short rests** and **no long rests**. 

#### Short Rests 

* **Ration**: Consumes one set of rations.
* **Time**: Requires one hour of time.
* **Safety**: Requires a (relatively) safe location free of hostiles.
* **Healing**: Consumes one or more Hit Dice to restore hit points.


#### Long Rests 

Long rests are taken **between** sessions, rather than during sessions. [Wizards](../character_creation/class/wizard) should take particular care to ensure that they can continue to survive even if their spell slots are expended. [Scrolls](../gear/scrolls) are a handy tool for this purpose.

{: .note}
> **Review: Hit Dice**
>
> Adventurers have a number of hit dice equal to their level. These hit dice can be rolled on a short rest to restore hit points. Hit dice recover on a long rest.

<!-- #### Potions

[Healing Potions](../../gear/alchemics/potions) are a useful, if expensive, way to recover hit points. They generally see use during tense combat situations. _Potions of Cleansing_ are also invaluable for treating mundane poisons.

#### Healing Magic

[Clerics](../../character_creation/class/cleric) are the sole spellcasters capable of using healing spells like *Cure Wounds*. They may expend a spell slot to do so, or make use of [spell scrolls](../../gear/scrolls) with the appropriate magic. -->
