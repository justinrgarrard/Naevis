# Rest

#### Short Rests 

Short rests are the preferred method to recover while exploring the City. A short rest takes one hour of time and consumes one set of rations. It can be taken so long as the surrounding area is free of immediate dangers. Many abilities, particularly Fighter abilities, recharge on a short rest.

#### Long Rests 

Long rests are taken **between** sessions. Players will not typically have the opportunity for a long rest during a session. 

<!-- #### Potions

[Healing Potions](../../gear/alchemics/potions) are a useful, if expensive, way to recover hit points. They generally see use during tense combat situations. _Potions of Cleansing_ are also invaluable for treating mundane poisons.

#### Healing Magic

[Clerics](../../character_creation/class/cleric) are the sole spellcasters capable of using healing spells like *Cure Wounds*. They may expend a spell slot to do so, or make use of [spell scrolls](../../gear/scrolls) with the appropriate magic. -->
