# Downtime

#### Between Sessions

Between each gameplay session, adventurers can choose one downtime activity to perform. They are also subject to a **25 gp lifestyle expense fee**, which entails room, board, and protection money to pay off local gangs.

{: .downtime}
> **Cleric: Read Omens**
> 
> During the next session, you gain the ability to alter fate one time. You can reroll an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw. Alternatively, you can force an attack roll against you to be rerolled. For any reroll, the new value is used.

{: .downtime}
> **Fighter: Conditioning Drills**
> 
> Start the next session with temporary hit points equal to twice your character level. You can change out your [Fighting Style](../../more/classes/fighter#fighting-style) for a different option.

{: .downtime}
> **Rogue: Specialty Work**
> 
> Waive the lifestyle expenses for this downtime. You can replace the skills you have [Expertise](../../more/classes/rogue#expertise) in with any other skills you are proficient with.

{: .downtime}
> **Wizard: Research**
> 
> You can expend gold to perform one or both of the following tasks.
> 
> * (25 gp) Add a spell from a [scroll](../../gear/scrolls) to your spellbook
> * (25 gp) Create a first-level scroll from a spell in your spellbook
>
> If you have a feature like [Evocation Savant](../../more/archetypes/wizard_evocation) you gain twice the benefit for performing a task with the appropriate spells. For example, you can create two *Magic Missile* scrolls during downtime at a total cost of 25 gp.
