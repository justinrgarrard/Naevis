# Downtime

#### Between Sessions

Between each gameplay session, adventurers can choose one downtime activity to perform.

{: .downtime}
> **Cleric: Read Omens**
> 
> During the next session, you gain the ability to alter fate one time. You can reroll an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw. Alternatively, you can force an attack roll against you to be rerolled. For any reroll, the new value is used.

{: .downtime}
> **Fighter: Conditioning Drills**
> 
> Start the next session with temporary hit points equal to twice your character level. You can change your *Fighting Style* to any other *Fighting Style*.

{: .downtime}
> **Rogue: Thievery**
> 
> Waive the downtime fee. You can replace the skills you have *Expertise* in with any other skills you are proficient with.

{: .downtime}
> **Wizard: Research**
> 
> You can choose to perform one or more of the following:
> 
> * (25 gp) Add a spell from a scroll to your spellbook
> * (25 gp) Create a first-level [scroll](../../gear/scrolls) from a spell in your spellbook
>
> The cost of both options is halved when using a relevant feature (i.e. _Evocation Savant_).
