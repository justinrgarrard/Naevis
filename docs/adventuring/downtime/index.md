# Downtime

#### Between Sessions

Between each gameplay session, adventurers can choose one downtime activity to perform.

{: .downtime}
> **Cleric: Read Omens**
> 
> During the next session, you gain the ability to alter fate a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You can reroll an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw. Alternatively, you can force an attack roll against you to be rerolled. For any reroll, the new value is used.

{: .downtime}
> **Fighter: Conditioning Drills**
> 
> Start the next session with temporary hit points equal to twice your character level. You may change your Fighting Style to any other Fighting Style.

{: .downtime}

{: .downtime}
> **Wizard: Research**
> 
> Either add a scroll's spell to your spellbook, or create a first-level spell scroll from a spell in your spellbook. You do not need to pay a gold cost for either activity.
