# Alchemy

#### Brews and Bombs

Many adventurers dabble in the practice of alchemy, allowing them to create useful items at a reduced price during downtime. Performing alchemy requires proficiency in one or more tools, described below.

{: .downtime}

>
> Using an appropriate artisan tool and 25-100 gp of materials, create *Common*-rarity [alchemics](../../gear/alchemics/index). For each 25 gp spent, create one item. You must be proficient in required the tool to do so.
