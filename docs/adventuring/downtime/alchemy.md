# Alchemy

#### Brews and Bombs

Many adventurers dabble in the practice of alchemy, allowing them to create useful items at a reduced price during downtime. Performing alchemy requires proficiency in one or more tools, described below.

{: .downtime}
> **Craft Alchemic**
>
> Using an appropriate artisan tool and 25-100 gp of materials, create *Common*-rarity [alchemics](../../gear/alchemics/index). For each 25 gp spent, create one item. You must be proficient in the tool to do so.

| Artisan Tool      | Alchemic                                         |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| Alchemist         | [Substances](../../gear/alchemics/substances) |
| Herbalist         | [Potions](../../gear/alchemics/potions)       |
| Poisoner          | [Poisons](../../gear/alchemics/poisons)       |
| Tinker            | [Grenades](../../gear/alchemics/grenades)     |
