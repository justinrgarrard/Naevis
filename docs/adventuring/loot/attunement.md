# Attunement

#### Use Magic Item

Most magic items, including [charms](../../gear/charms/index) and [sentient weapons](../../more/city_items/sentient_weapons), require attunement to use. An adventurer must form a mental bond with the item in order to bring out its latent powers. 

{: .note}
> **Charisma Limiter**
> 
> The maximum number of items an adventurer can attune to is equal to: **(Charisma Modifier + 1)**. An adventurer with a negative modifier is unable to attune to magic items. This limitation reflects the difficulty of bonding and managing multiple semi-sentient items at one time.

#### Identification and Bonding

The attunement process can be done over a short rest. In order to attune to an item, the wielder must be proficient with it and understand its function. The latter can be achieved through the _Identify_ spell or by paying 25 gp to a merchant during downtime.
