# Loot

#### Acquiring Valuable Things

Loot can take many different forms. A pile of [City Dweller](../the_frontier/city_dwellers/index) books could be loot, as could quills from a basilisk. The key question to ask is whether or not someone would find this item valuable. Often times the answer is determined by an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

#### Weight

The value of loot is determined by its weight. [Backpacks](../gear/adventuring_gear/tools) can store 30 lbs of goods up to a volume of one cubic foot (and weigh 5 lbs on their own). 

{: .mundane-item}
> **Loot (25 gp)**
>
> *Treasure, 5 lb.*
>
> Carefully preserved monster viscera, rocks that glow when exposed to moonlight, damaged armor made of quality materials; this is anything that might be of interest to a curious merchant.

{: .note}
> **Backpacks**
>
> Adventurers typically have items already present in their pack, like rations and tools. These items count against the weight and space limit of a backpack. An adventurer can have one backpack.

{: .note}
> **Pouches**
>
> Pouches are smaller containers that can hold up to six lb. of items. An adventurer can have one pouch.

> While adventurers can stash their loot in the same backpack as their supplies, doing so may have unpredictable effects. It is generally unwise to place magical objects, poisonous glands, or other strange substances near one's rations and spell scrolls. -->
