# Magic Items

#### Identification

Adventurers are likely to find all manner of magic items while exploring the City Below. The purpose of an item is generally unclear until the _Identify_ spell is used upon it.

#### Attunement

Magic items like [charms](../gear/charms) require the user to bond them before drawing out their power. This process can be done (or undone) during a short or long rest. If the item is cursed, the attunement bond cannot be undone until the curse is broken.

> **Charisma Limit**
> 
> In Naevis, the number of magic items an adventurer can attune to is equal to: (Charisma Modifier + 1), to a minimum of 1.
