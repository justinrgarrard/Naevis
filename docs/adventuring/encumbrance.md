#### Managing Weight

An adventurer's Strength score determines how many pounds they can shoulder without penalty. 

| Strength | Slowed | Disadvantage | Immobile |
| :------- | -----: | -----------: | -------: |
| 8        |     40 |           80 |      120 |
| 10       |     50 |          100 |      150 |
| 12       |     60 |          120 |      180 |
| 14       |     70 |          140 |      210 |
| 16       |     80 |          160 |      240 |
