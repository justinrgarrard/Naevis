# Awareness

#### Detection

An adventurer's passive **Perception** determines what they notice without actively searching. The Game Master will use this value to determine what traps or secrets characters notice without having to roll dice.

#### Traps

Many areas contain dangerous hazards, whether mechanical or environmental. Players can actively request to **Investigate** an area or object for dangers, allowing them to spot details that their passive detection skills failed to discern.

#### Stealth

In the event that an adventurer attempts to move stealthily, the **GM will roll for the player**. In this way, the player does not know if they succeeded or failed their stealth check.
