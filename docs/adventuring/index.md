# Adventuring

#### The Premise

Adventurers have come from far and wide to explore the newly discovered [**Forgotten City**](../the_frontier/city_below), a ruin overflowing with exotic treasures and terrible dangers. They have settled in a desert outpost called the [**Canvaslands**](../the_frontier/canvaslands/index) just outside the City's entrance.

#### Expeditions

The main goal of a session is to fill a bag with treasure. One [***Backpack of Loot***](loot) is enough to pay an individual's room and board (25 gp) while still generating a profit. 

{: .mundane-item}
> **Backpack of Loot (50 gp)**
>
> *Treasure, 15 lb.*
>
> Carefully preserved monster viscera, rocks that glow when exposed to moonlight, damaged armor made of quality materials; this is anything that might be of interest to a curious merchant.
>
> The contents can be sold for 50 gp, after which this item reverts to an empty backpack.

#### Downtime

Between each session, two things take place:

1. **Downtime Fee**: Adventurers must pay 25 gp for room and board, as well as for "protection" from the local gangs.
2. **Downtime Activity**: Adventurers can perform one [downtime activity](downtime/index).

Failure to pay the Downtime Fee puts an adventurer into a temporary [retirement](death#backfill) for one session, as they work to pay off debts to dangerous individuals.

<!-- #### Diving Deeper

As parties become better established and [better equipped](../gear/index) they'll be able to dig deeper into the City's mysteries. They may stumble across [swords that speak](../more/magic_items/minor_sentient_weapons), [gods that walk the land](../the_frontier/city_dwellers/devil_princes), and other oddities with the power to throw Naevis into chaos. [Powerful nations](../the_frontier/greenlands/elves) are likely to take an interest in such things.  -->
