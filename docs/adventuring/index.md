# Adventuring

#### The Premise

Adventurers have come from far and wide to explore the newly discovered [**Forgotten City**](../the_frontier/city_below), a ruin overflowing with exotic treasures and terrible dangers. They have settled in a desert outpost called the [**Canvaslands**](../the_frontier/canvaslands/index) just outside the City's entrance.

#### Expeditions

The main goal of an expedition is to **Fill a Bag**. One *Backpack of Loot* is enough to pay an individual's room and board while still generating a profit. 

{: .mundane-item}
> **Backpack of Loot (50 gp)**
>
> *Treasure, 15 lb.*
>
> Carefully preserved monster viscera, rocks that glow when exposed to moonlight, damaged armor made of quality materials; this is anything that might be of interest to a curious merchant.
>
> The contents can be sold for 50 gp, after which this item reverts to an empty backpack.

{: .note}
> **The Downtime Tax**
> 
> Adventurers can expect to **spend 20 gp between each session** on living necessities. Those that can't afford to pay will be penalized first with a level of exhaustion, then with a dangerous debt, and finally an early end to their adventuring career.



<!-- #### Inventory

A key component of these expeditions is packing one's bag. Managing weight is a crucial aspect of diving, and a measure of space must be reserved for carrying out [loot](tactics/loot). -->

<!-- #### Downtime

Parties are able to rest and unwind between sessions. In addition to the benefits of a long rest, adventurers can also participate in a downtime activity such as [brewing potions](downtime/alchemy) or [performing](downtime/alchemy) at taverns. However, they should be wary of the **20 gp Downtime Tax** that must be paid in order to secure room and board.  -->
