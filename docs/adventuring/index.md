# Adventuring

#### The Premise

Adventurers have come from far and wide to explore the newly discovered [**Forgotten City**](../the_frontier/city_below), a ruin overflowing with exotic treasures and terrible dangers. They have settled in a desert outpost called the [**Canvaslands**](../the_frontier/canvaslands/index) just outside the City's entrance.

#### Expeditions

The main goal of a session is to fill a bag with treasure. Ten pounds of [***Loot***](loot) is more than enough to pay for room and board, with most adventurers seeking out opportunities to fill as much as their [packs can hold](../gear/index#pack-limitations).

{: .mundane-item}
> **Loot (25 gp)**
>
> *Treasure, 5 lb.*
>
> Carefully preserved monster viscera, rocks that glow when exposed to moonlight, damaged armor made of quality materials; this is anything that might be of interest to a curious merchant.


{: .note}
> **Downtime**
>
> Between each session, adventurers must pay the downtime fee (25 gp) and choose a [downtime activity](downtime/index). The fee represents gold spent on food and shelter, as well as protection money paid to [local gangs](../the_frontier/canvaslands/corsairs).
>
> Failure to pay the Downtime Fee puts an adventurer into a temporary [retirement](death#backfill) for one session, as they work to pay off debts to dangerous individuals.

<!-- #### Diving Deeper

As parties become better established and [better equipped](../gear/index) they'll be able to dig deeper into the City's mysteries. They may stumble across [swords that speak](../more/magic_items/minor_sentient_weapons), [gods that walk the land](../the_frontier/city_dwellers/devil_princes), and other oddities with the power to throw Naevis into chaos. [Powerful nations](../the_frontier/greenlands/elves) are likely to take an interest in such things.  -->
