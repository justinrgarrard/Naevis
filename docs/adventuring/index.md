# Adventuring

#### The Premise

Adventurers have come from far and wide to explore the newly discovered [**Forgotten City**](../the_frontier/city_below), a ruin overflowing with exotic treasures and terrible dangers. They have settled in a desert outpost called the [**Canvaslands**](../the_frontier/canvaslands/index) just outside the City's entrance.

#### Expeditions

The main goal of a session is to **Fill a Bag**. One [***Backpack of Loot***](loot) is enough to pay an individual's room and board while still generating a profit. 

{: .mundane-item}
> **Backpack of Loot (50 gp)**
>
> *Treasure, 15 lb.*
>
> Carefully preserved monster viscera, rocks that glow when exposed to moonlight, damaged armor made of quality materials; this is anything that might be of interest to a curious merchant.
>
> The contents can be sold for 50 gp, after which this item reverts to an empty backpack.

#### Diving Deeper

As parties become better established and [better equipped](../gear/index) they'll be able to dig deeper into the City's mysteries. They may stumble across [swords that speak](../more/magic_items/minor_sentient_weapons), [gods that walk the land](../the_frontier/city_dwellers/devil_princes), and other oddities with the power to throw Naevis into chaos. [Powerful nations](../the_frontier/greenlands/elves) are likely to take an interest in such things.
