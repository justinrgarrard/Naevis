# Adventuring

#### The Premise

Adventurers have come from far and wide to explore the newly discovered [Forgotten City](), a ruin overflowing with exotic treasures and terrible dangers. They have settled in a desert outpost called the [Canvaslands]() just outside the City's entrance.

#### Expeditions

Parties of adventurers come together for expeditions into the City. Due to the dangers involved, these trips involve **no long rests**. 

<!-- #### Inventory

A key component of these expeditions is packing one's bag. Managing weight is a crucial aspect of diving, and a measure of space must be reserved for carrying out [loot](tactics/loot). -->

#### Downtime

Parties are able to rest and unwind between sessions. In addition to the benefits of a long rest, adventurers can also participate in a downtime activity such as [brewing potions](downtime/alchemy) or [performing](downtime/alchemy) at taverns. However, they should be wary of the **20 gp Downtime Tax** that must be paid in order to secure room and board.
