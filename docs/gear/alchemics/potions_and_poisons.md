#### Poisons

{: .mundane-item}
> **Mellow Dust (3)**
> 
> *Poison, contact, illicit*
> 
> A non-hostile creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be charmed by you. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. After 1 hour the effect ends and the creature knows it was charmed by you. This effect ends early if you or your allies do anything harmful to the creature. If the user has proficiency in _Poisoner's Kits_, the DC increases by their proficiency bonus.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Scorpion Venom (3)**
> 
> *Poison, injury, illicit*
> 
> Creatures injured by a weapon coated in this poison take an additional 1d4 poison damage. Creatures immune to poison are unaffected, and those with resistance take half.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Sleeping Powder (3)**
> 
> *Poison, inhaled, illicit*
> 
> When released into the air, this powder fills a 5 foot cube. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for ten minutes. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake. If the user has proficiency in _Poisoner's Kits_, the DC increases by their proficiency bonus.
