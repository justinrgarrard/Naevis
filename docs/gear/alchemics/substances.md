> **Agua Regia**
> 
> *Substance, common, 50 gp, 1 lb.*
> 
> This acid is identical to a _vial of acid_, but possesses additional properties. When applied to non-magical metals that are not being worn or carried, the metals dissolve with a quiet hissing noise over the course of one minute.


{: .mundane-item}
> **Luminessence**
> 
> *Substance, common, 50 gp, 1 lb.*
> 
> This liquid is identical to a _flask of holy water_, but possesses additional properties. When shaken, it emits bright green light for 40 feet and dim light for 40 feet further for ten minutes. The water retains its potency and can be reactivated by shaking again. If applied to an object or creature, they remain lit for ten minutes and cannot become invisible. Any message written with the substance will be invisible to the naked eye, but glow when exposed to a _Light_ spell.


{: .mundane-item}
> **Midnight Oil**
> 
> *Substance, common, 50 gp, 1 lb.*
> 
> This oil is identical to a _flask of oil_, but possesses additional properties. When you coat an object or creature with this oil, any sounds the target makes become muffled for ten minutes, providing advantage on relevant Dexterity (Stealth) rolls and preventing spells with a verbal component. The oil can be wiped off with an action.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Pale Soap**
> 
> *Substance, common, 50 gp, 1 lb.*
> 
> This soap is identical to a _bar of soap_, but possesses additional properties. Grime, blood, rust, or other corrosion are instantly removed by the soap. Simple illusions, such as those produced by _Minor Illusion_, _Silent Image_, or _Disguise Self_ are also dispersed on contact with the soap. The soap becomes blackened and crumbles apart when touching a fey, fiend, aberration, or undead creature.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Winterbloom Extract**
> 
> *Substance, common, 50 gp, 1 lb.*
> 
> This fluid is identical to a _flask of alchemist fire_, but causes rapid freezing rather than combustion. When thrown into water it freezes up to 20 gallons into solid ice. When thrown on to a wet creature or object, the target is frozen, and gains the Restrained condition. A creature can end this condition by using its action to make a DC 10 Strength check to break away.
