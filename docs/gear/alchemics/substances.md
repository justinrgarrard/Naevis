#### Substances

{: .mundane-item}
> **Alchemical Glue**
> 
> *Substance, common, 50 gp, 1 lb.*
> 
> This flask contains enough glue to cover a 1-foot square surface. The substance quickly hardens when exposed to air, forming a concrete-like material. As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the glue as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target gains the Restrained condition. A creature can end this condition by using its action to make a DC 10 Strength check to break away. A door or container sealed with glue requires a DC 20 Strength check to open.


{: .mundane-item}
> **Agua Regia**
> 
> *Substance, common, 50 gp, 1 lb.*
> 
> This acid is identical to a _vial of acid_, but possesses additional properties. When applied to non-magical metals, up to one cubic foot of metal can be dissolved with a quiet hissing noise over the course of one minute. The acid is corrosive to stone and wood to a lesser extent. It can be used to remove *Alchemical Glue* once hardened.


{: .mundane-item}
> **Luminessence**
> 
> *Substance, common, 50 gp, 1 lb.*
> 
> This liquid is identical to a _flask of holy water_, but possesses additional properties. When shaken, it emits bright green light for 40 feet and dim light for 40 feet further for ten minutes. The water retains its potency and can be reactivated by shaking again. If applied to an object or creature, they remain lit for ten minutes and cannot become invisible. Any message written with the substance will be invisible to the naked eye, but glow when exposed to a _Light_ spell.


{: .mundane-item}
> **Midnight Oil**
> 
> *Substance, common, 50 gp, 1 lb.*
> 
> This oil is identical to a _flask of oil_, but possesses additional properties. When you coat an object or creature with this oil, any sounds the target makes become muffled for ten minutes, providing advantage on relevant Dexterity (Stealth) rolls and preventing spells with a verbal component. The oil can be wiped off with an action.
>
> When the oil is burned, a 20 foot cloud of smoke forms. The smoke spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for ten minutes or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.


<!-- {: .mundane-item}
> **Pale Soap**
> 
> *Substance, common, 50 gp, 1 lb.*
> 
> This soap is identical to a _bar of soap_, but possesses additional properties. Grime, blood, rust, or other corrosion are instantly removed by the soap. Simple illusions, such as those produced by _Minor Illusion_, _Silent Image_, or _Disguise Self_ are also dispersed on contact with the soap. The outer surface of the soap becomes blackened and corroded if placed within five feet of a fey, fiend, aberration, or undead creature.


{: .mundane-item}
> **Winterbloom Extract**
> 
> *Substance, common, 50 gp, 1 lb.*
> 
> This fluid is identical to a _flask of alchemist fire_, but deals cold damage instead of fire damage. When thrown into water it freezes up to 20 gallons into solid ice. When thrown on to a wet creature or object, the target is frozen and gains the Restrained condition. A creature can end this condition by using its action to make a DC 10 Strength check to break the ice. -->
