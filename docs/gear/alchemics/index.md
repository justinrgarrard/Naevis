# Alchemics (50 gp)

#### Wonders of Natural Philosophy

The discipline of alchemy is founded upon the transmutation of ingredients into useful items by mundane means. Tools, rather than spellcasting, are its basis. Alchemic items can be **purchased for 50 gp** or sold for half that amount.

> Adventurers proficient in **Halfling** can purchase alchemics at the discounted price of **40 gp**.

<!-- #### Crafting

Adventurers proficient with the right type of artisan tools can [craft alchemics](../../adventuring/downtime/alchemy) during [downtime](../../adventuring/downtime/index). The basis consists of combining mundane ingredients with energy from magical materials. For example, a _Potion of Healing_ might combine a selection of herbal leaves with distilled holy water. -->
