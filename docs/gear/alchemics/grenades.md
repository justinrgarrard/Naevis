> *Grenade, 5 lb., common*
> 
> As an action, you can throw this ball up to 20 feet from you. Upon impact it explodes into a sphere of smoke 20 feet wide.

> **Thunderbomb**
> 
> *Grenade, 5 lb., common*

> As an action, you can throw this ball up to 20 feet from you. Upon impact it explodes with a peal of thunder.
> 
> Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from the grenade must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed  save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the cube. On a successful save, the creature  takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.
> 
> In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the grenade's effect, and the grenade emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.
