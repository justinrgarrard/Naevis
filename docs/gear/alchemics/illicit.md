# Illicit Goods

{: .note}
> **Cant**
>
> Illicit goods can only be purchased or sold by those proficient in [Cant](../../more/languages/cant).

#### Grenades

{: .mundane-item}
> **Firebomb**
> 
> *Grenade, common, illicit*
> 
> As an action, you can throw this ball up to 20 feet from you. Upon impact it explodes into a 15 foot cone of fire facing away from its user.
> 
> Each creature in its cone must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the user has proficiency in _Tinker's Tools_, the DC increases by their proficiency bonus.
> 
> The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Flashbomb**
> 
> *Grenade, common, illicit*
> 
> As an action, you can throw this ball up to 20 feet from you. Upon impact it explodes into a flash of blinding light.
> 
> Each creature within 300 feet must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of their next turn. If the user has proficiency in _Tinker's Tools_, the DC increases by their proficiency bonus. A creature that warned about the grenade automatically succeeds its save, as does the user of the grenade. Creatures with darkvision have disadvantage on saves against the grenade.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Thunderbomb**
> 
> *Grenade, common, illicit*
> 
> As an action, you can throw this ball up to 20 feet from you. Upon impact it explodes with a peal of thunder.
> 
> Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from the grenade must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed  save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the cube. On a successful save, the creature  takes half as much damage and isn't pushed. If the user has proficiency in _Tinker's Tools_, the DC increases by their proficiency bonus.
> 
> In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the grenade's effect, and the grenade emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.

#### Poisons

{: .mundane-item}
> **Mellow Dust (3)**
> 
> *Poison, contact, illicit*
> 
> A non-hostile creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be charmed by you. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. After 1 hour the effect ends and the creature knows it was charmed by you. This effect ends early if you or your allies do anything harmful to the creature. If the user has proficiency in _Poisoner's Kits_, the DC increases by their proficiency bonus.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Scorpion Venom (3)**
> 
> *Poison, injury, illicit*
> 
> Creatures injured by a weapon coated in this poison take an additional 1d4 poison damage. Creatures immune to poison are unaffected, and those with resistance take half.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Sleeping Powder (3)**
> 
> *Poison, inhaled, illicit*
> 
> When released into the air, this powder fills a 5 foot cube. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for ten minutes. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake. If the user has proficiency in _Poisoner's Kits_, the DC increases by their proficiency bonus.

{: .note}
> **Review: Poisons**
>
> ***Contact***. Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.
> 
> ***Ingested***. A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. 
> 
> ***Inhaled***. These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one's breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.
> 
> ***Injury***. Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.
