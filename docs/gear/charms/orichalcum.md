>
> A short blade that raises the hair on one's arm when held.
> 
> This weapon can be used as a spellcasting focus. While attuned to this dagger and holding it, you can cast the *Shocking Grasp* cantrip using Charisma as your spellcasting modifier. You can change the cantrip's range to 10 feet instead of touch when using the dagger as a spellcasting focus.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Mist Dagger**
> 
> *Weapon (Dagger), common, requires attunement*
>
> A short blade that blurs strangely when swung.
> 
> When attuned, this dagger reappears in the wielder's hand immediately after it is used to make a throwing attack. If lost or discarded, it will reappear in the pack of whomever it is attuned to within 24 hours. It counts as a magical weapon for the purposes of bypassing damage resistance when attuned.

> **Phantom Dagger**
> 
> *Weapon (Dagger), common, requires attunement*
>
> A short blade that feels as though it's filled with sloshing liquid.

> When attuned, the wielder can use a bonus action while swinging it to extend an invisible blade past the dagger's edge, up to 10 feet away. The dagger has the _Reach_ property when used in this way. It counts as a magical weapon for the purposes of bypassing damage resistance when attuned.
