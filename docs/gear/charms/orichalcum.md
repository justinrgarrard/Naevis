# Orichalcum

{: .mundane-item}
> **Mage Dagger**
> 
> *Weapon (Dagger), spellcasting focus, common, requires attunement*
>
> A short blade that raises the hair on one's arm when held.
> 
> While attuned to this dagger and holding it, you can cast the [*Shocking Grasp*](../../../srd_spells/shocking_grasp) cantrip using Charisma as your spellcasting modifier. If you are a spellcaster, the range of the cantrip increases to 10 feet, you can use the dagger as a spellcasting focus for other spells, and you can choose to make the cantrip's damage non-lethal.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Mist Dagger**
> 
> *Weapon (Dagger), common, requires attunement*
>
> A short blade that blurs strangely when swung.
> 
> When attuned, this dagger reappears in the wielder's hand immediately after it is used to make a throwing attack. If lost or discarded, it will reappear in the pack of whomever it is attuned to within 24 hours. 

{: .mundane-item}
> **Phantom Dagger**
> 
> *Weapon (Dagger), common, requires attunement*
>
> A short blade that feels as though it's filled with sloshing liquid.
> 
> When attuned and held, the wielder can extend an invisible blade past the dagger's edge by swinging it. The dagger has the _Reach_ property and deals slashing damage instead of piercing when used in this way.
