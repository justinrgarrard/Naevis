# Glass

{: .mundane-item}
> **Glass Flute of Illusions**
> 
> *Instrument, common, requires attunement*
>
> An obsidian flute that seems to suck in light.
> 
> This flute makes no noise when played, but instead recreates the effects of the [*Silent Image*](../../../srd_spells/silent_image) spell. The wielder must make a Charisma (Performance) check and treat the result as the save DC. The image persists only while the user continues to perform, but otherwise is not limited in duration. Taking any action besides playing the flute disperses the illusion.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Glass Gems of Lightbending**
> 
> *Glass Gem, common, requires attunement*
>
> A pair of gems that look to be made of quicksilver.
> 
> These gems come in pairs and can be used without attunement. When either gem is squeezed, the other briefly brightens, no matter the distance between the two. Users proficient in [Cant](../more/languages/index) can communicate in full sentences using this item. 
>
> While attuned to these gems and carrying both, you can use them to cast the [*Minor Illusion*](../../../srd_spells/minor_illusion) cantrip, but only for visual effects. If you are a spellcaster, the range of the cantrip is multiplied by your proficiency bonus.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Glass Lens of Firestarting**
> 
> *Magnifying glass, common, requires attunement*
>
> A handheld magnifying glass that emits light.
> 
> While attuned and held, the wielder can cast the [*Light*](../../../srd_spells/light) spell, but only on the glass lens itself. The glass can also be used to ignite a flammable object with an action provided that the object is within five feet. If you are a spellcaster, you can change the shape of the *Light* spell to emulate a [bullseye lantern](../adventuring_gear/lighting).

{: .mundane-item}
> **Glass Ring of Force**
> 
> *Ring, common, requires attunement*
>
> This ring feels oddly heavy, but weighing it on a scale shows no discrepancies.
> 
> While attuned to this ring, you can cast the [*Mage Hand*](../../../srd_spells/mage_hand) cantrip. If you are a spellcaster, the weight of objects you can lift, the range of the cantrip, and the movement speed of the hand are multiplied by your proficiency bonus.
