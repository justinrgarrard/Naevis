# Glass

{: .mundane-item}
> **Glass Flute of Illusions**
> 
> *Instrument, common, requires attunement*
>
> An obsidian flute that seems to suck in light.
> 
> This flute makes no noise when played, but instead recreates the effects of the *Silent Image* spell. The user must make a Charisma (Performance) check and treat the result as the save DC. The image persists only while the user continues to perform. Taking any action besides playing the flute disperses the illusion.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Glass Gems of Lightbending**
> 
> *Glass Gem, common, requires attunement*
>
> A pair of mirror-polish gems that look to be made of quicksilver.
> 
> These gems comes in pairs. When either gem is squeezed, the other briefly brightens, no matter the distance between the two. Users proficient in [Cant](../more/languages/index) can communicate in full sentences using this item. Additionally, the gems can be used as mirrors, magnifying glasses, and spyglasses in the hands of the attuner.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Glass Ring of Force**
> 
> *Ring, common, requires attunement*
>
> This ring feels oddly heavy, but weighing it on a scale shows no discrepancies.
> 
> While attuned to this ring, you can cast the *Mage Hand* cantrip, even if you aren't a spellcaster. If you are a spellcaster, the weight of objects you can lift, the range of the cantrip, and the movement speed of the hand are multiplied by your proficiency bonus.
