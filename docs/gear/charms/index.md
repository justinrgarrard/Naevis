# Charms (50 gp)

Charms are magical tools crafted from materials found within the City. Charms can be **purchased for 50 gp** and sold for half that amount.

> **Attunement**
>
> Most charms require [attunement](../../adventuring/loot/attunement) to use. In Naevis, adventurers with a negative Charisma modifier cannot attune to items.
