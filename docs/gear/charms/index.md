# Charms (50 gp)

Charms are magical tools crafted from materials found within the City. The process of their creation results in a small measure of consciousness, usually manifest in an eagerness to perform their function, and requires users to [attune](../../adventuring/loot/attunement). Charms can be **purchased for 50** and sold for half that amount.
