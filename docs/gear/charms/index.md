# Charms (50 gp)

#### Wonders of Artifice

Charms are magical tools crafted from materials found within the City. The process of their creation results in a small measure of consciousness, usually manifest in an eagerness to perform their function. Charms can be **purchased for 50** and sold for half that amount.

{: .note}
> **Attunement**
>
> Charms are unable to be used without attunement. The would-be wielder must form a mental bond with their item over the course of a short or long rest. 
> 
> The maximum number of items an adventurer can attune to is equal to: **(Charisma Modifier + 1)**, to a minimum of 1. This reflects the difficulty of managing multiple semi-sentient items at one time.
