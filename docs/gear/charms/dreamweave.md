# Dreamweave 

{: .mundane-item}
> **Boots of Leaping**
> 
> *Boots, common, requires attunement*
>
> A pair of leather boots that seem to float ever so slightly off the ground.
> 
> While wearing and attuned to these boots, you can use a bonus action to increase your jump range until the start of your next turn. Your long jump distance becomes 20 feet and your high jump distance becomes 10 feet. Additionally, you are unaffected by difficult terrain while this effect in place.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Compliant Rope**
> 
> *Weapon (Whip), common, requires attunement*
> 
> A rope with an oily appearance that can change shape, elongating and hardening at the wielder's command.
> 
> While attuned and held, this rope can change its form to any of the following: a whip, 100 feet of rope, a quarterstaff, or a ten-foot pole. The rope weighs 1 lb. regardless of form. It counts as a magical weapon for the purposes of bypassing damage resistance when attuned.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Djinn Cloak**
> 
> *Cloak, common, requires attunement*
>
> A cloak that defies gravity, flowing behind the wearer as though it were suspended in water.
> 
> While attuned and worn, the wearer glides rather than falls, rendering them resistant to fall damage and able to roughly control their descent. When folded into the shape of a backpack, any contents placed within weigh thirty pounds less, provided that they remain within five feet of the attuner. A backpack of this form can hold up to 60 pounds or one cubic foot of material.
