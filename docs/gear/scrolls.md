# Scrolls

#### Purchase

Spell scrolls are a crucial resource for wizards and a handy tool for clerics. First-level [spells](../more/spells/index) can be purchased for **50 gp** and sold for half that amount. Higher level scrolls are largely unavailable for purchase.

> Adventurers proficient in **Elven** can purchase scrolls at the discounted price of **40 gp**.

#### Crafting

Wizards can create spell scrolls during their [downtime](../the_city_below/downtime/index). Scroll scribing is a significant industry comparable to blacksmithing. Low-level magecraft is common to many professions, from scholarship to warcraft, and the manufacture of spell scrolls is considered vital to any nation or power.

{: .note}
> **Review: Scroll Usage**
>
> * Scrolls can only be used by spellcasters. The spell must be on the spellcaster's spell list.
>
> * The modifiers for spells cast from a scroll are based on the scroll's level. A first-level spell scroll has a save DC of **13** and an attack bonus of **+5**.
> 
> * If the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.

> A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.
