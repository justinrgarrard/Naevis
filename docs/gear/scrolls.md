# Scrolls (50 gp)

[Mages](../character_creation/class/wizard) (and to a lesser extent [Priests](../character_creation/class/cleric)) are prized as scroll-users. Even the meekest of mages can become portable artillery when girded with half a dozen *Thunderwave* scrolls. A first-level scroll can be **purchased for 50 gp** or sold for half that amount.

> Adventurers proficient in **Elven** can purchase scrolls at the discounted price of **40 gp**.

> A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost. 
> 
> If the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.
> 
> Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.
>
> A spell cast from this scroll has a save DC of **13** and an attack bonus of **+5**.
