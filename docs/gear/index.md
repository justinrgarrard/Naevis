# Gear

#### Packing a Bag

An adventurer's inventory is a crucial resource, every bit as important as health or spells. The right item can mean the difference between life and death, as can the [**weight**](../adventuring/encumbrance) of one's pack. Be sure to make use of [**alchemics**](alchemics/index), [**scrolls**](scrolls), and [**charms**](charms) to supplement more mundane means of self-preservation.

#### Starting Equipment

Adventurers can use their class' starting pack to begin play, or purchase their own equipment with **100 gp**.

* [Cleric's Pack](../character_creation/class/cleric#starting-gear)
* [Fighter's Pack](../character_creation/class/fighter#starting-gear)
* [Rogue's Pack](../character_creation/class/rogue#starting-gear)
* [Wizard's Pack](../character_creation/class/wizard#starting-gear)


<!-- #### The Main Concerns

* **Lighting**: Do you have a way to see in darkness?

* **Rations**: Do you have enough provisions to take [short rests](../adventuring/recovery)?

* **Warcraft**: Do you have weapons and armor?

* **Spellcraft**: If you are a spellcaster, do you have a magic focus?

* **Loot**: Do you have room for treasure? -->

<!-- #### Failsafes

Beyond the main concerns, adventurers should also prep single-use items for emergencies. Healing potions, scrolls, grenades, and similar tools can mean the difference between survival and early grave. -->
