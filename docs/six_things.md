## Naevis In Six Paragraphs

#### 1. Dwarves and Elves

> For millennia, the two long-lived races have warred for supremacy over the known world. The [Elven Empire](character_creation/race/elf) seeks to bring all nations under its dominion. They believe themselves the rightful stewards of the world, and of all other races. [Dwarven City-States](character_creation/race/dwarf) contest this claim with steel and fire. Both make use of [human slaves](character_creation/race/human) as pawns in their ancient wargames, while the [halfling tribes](character_creation/race/halfling) quietly broker trade between factions.

#### 2. Discovery of the City Below

> Deep in the Nameless Desert, far from either great power, a shattered ruin was discovered. Tunnels beneath its broken buildings were filled with treasures, unknown magics, and terrible monsters. Rumors abound of entire subterranean civilizations lurking within. Sensing the opportunity to secure an advantage, the elves and the dwarves sent forth sponsored adventurers to dredge anything of value from its depths.

#### 3. Founding of the Canvaslands

> Adventurers flocked to the City Below in waves. Hundreds of miles from the nearest settled land, they stood up tents and yurts which coalesced into a sprawling shantytown now called the Canvaslands. This makeshift city has become a lawless place ruled by slumlords and glorified bandit gangs. Its marketplaces, however, are the best in the known world. And while it may not be free of discrimination, it is the only place where one might find the four races working together without regard for status.

#### 4. Plumbing the Depths

> Navean adventurers are necessarily also survivalists. They carefully [pack their bags](gear/index) and prepare their spells to handle monsters, traps, hazardous terrain, poisons, and all manner of threats. Most are practiced in multiple [languages](more/languages/index), the better to talk their way out of a potentially lethal confrontation, and [tools](more/tools) for use in [alchemy](gear/alchemics/index).

#### 5. Navean Magic

> Naevis is a smaller, less fantastical world than the _Forgotten Realms_. The gods do not meddle in mortal affairs here. Magic is instead a modest tool practiced by [learned arcanists](character_creation/class/wizard) or [enigmatic cultists](character_creation/class/cleric).

#### 6. A Smaller World

> Naevis is based around the _[Basic Rules](DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf)_. There are no paladins, rangers, or warlocks in this setting. Likewise, races outside dwarves, elves, humans, and halflings are considered "uncivilized" at best and monstrous at worst. Gameplay options are more restricted than other settings, but in turn, they offer greater focus for players interested in a low-fantasy game. 

<!-- Magic is instead a modest tool. A trained magician is much like a doctor or lawyer, finding employment everywhere from the battlefield to city hall. A mystery cultist might lead a congregation of faithful as a village priest, or serve in a mercenary outfit. Magic is not so rare as to inspire terror among peasants, nor so potent that the world revolves around it. -->
