# Mist Dagger

*Weapon (Dagger), common, requires attunement*

A short blade that blurs strangely when swung.
 
When attuned, this dagger reappears in the wielder's hand immediately after it is used to make a throwing attack. If lost or discarded, it will reappear in the pack of whomever it is attuned to within 24 hours.
