# Phantom Dagger

*Weapon (Dagger), common, requires attunement*

A short blade that feels as though it's filled with sloshing liquid.

When attuned and held, the wielder can extend an invisible blade past the dagger's edge by swinging it. The dagger has the _Reach_ property and deals slashing damage instead of piercing when used in this way.
