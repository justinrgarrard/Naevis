# Sleeping Powder (3)

*Poison, inhaled, illicit*

When released into the air, this powder fills a 5 foot cube. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for ten minutes. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake. If the user has proficiency in _Poisoner's Kits_, the DC increases by their proficiency bonus.
