# Thunderbomb

*Grenade, common, illicit*

As an action, you can throw this ball up to 20 feet from you. Upon impact it explodes with a peal of thunder.

Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from the grenade must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed  save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the cube. On a successful save, the creature  takes half as much damage and isn't pushed. If the user has proficiency in _Tinker's Tools_, the DC increases by their proficiency bonus.

In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the grenade's effect, and the grenade emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.
