# Flashbomb

*Grenade, common, illicit*

As an action, you can throw this ball up to 20 feet from you. Upon impact it explodes into a flash of blinding light.

Each creature within 300 feet must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of their next turn. If the user has proficiency in _Tinker's Tools_, the DC increases by their proficiency bonus. A creature that warned about the grenade automatically succeeds its save, as does the user of the grenade. Creatures with darkvision have disadvantage on saves against the grenade.
