# Midnight Oil

*Substance, common*

This oil is identical to a _flask of oil_, but possesses additional properties.

* When thrown, you must make an attack roll against any creature within 5 feet of the original target to determine if they're also covered in oil.
* When poured, the oil fills a 15 foot square and creates difficult terrain.
* When burned, a fire is created for a number of rounds equal to twice the user's Intelligence modifier (minimum 2).
