# Mellow Dust (3)

*Poison, contact, illicit*

A non-hostile creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be charmed by you. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. After 1 hour the effect ends and the creature knows it was charmed by you. This effect ends early if you or your allies do anything harmful to the creature. If the user has proficiency in _Poisoner's Kits_, the DC increases by their proficiency bonus.
