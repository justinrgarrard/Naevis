# Agua Regia

*Substance, common*

This acid is identical to a _vial of acid_, but possesses additional properties. 

* When applied to non-magical metals, up to one cubic foot of metal can be dissolved with a quiet hissing noise over the course of one minute. 
* When applied to hardened *Alchemic Glue*, the glue dissolves instantly.
* When used to attack, the target takes additional damage equal to the user's Intelligence modifier (minimum 0).
