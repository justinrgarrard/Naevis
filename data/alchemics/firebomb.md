# Firebomb

*Grenade, common, illicit*

As an action, you can throw this ball up to 20 feet from you. Upon impact it explodes into a 15 foot cone of fire facing away from its user.

Each creature in its cone must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the user has proficiency in _Tinker's Tools_, the DC increases by their proficiency bonus.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.
