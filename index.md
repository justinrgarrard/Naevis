# The World of Naevis

#### What is Naevis?

Naevis is a low fantasy setting for **[Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition](https://dnd.wizards.com/start-playing-dnd)**. It's designed for **survival adventure** games that favor cunning, preparation, and creative problem solving. 

#### Highlights

* **Basic Rules Gameplay**: Classes, races, and spells are restricted to [Basic Rules](docs/more/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf) options. Make each decision count.

* **Dungeon Crawling**: Streamlined gameplay mechanics for [resting](docs/adventuring/recovery) and [downtime](docs/adventuring/downtime/index). Variant rules for [encumbrance](docs/adventuring/encumbrance) and [attunement](docs/adventuring/magic_items).

* **A Brave New World**: Enter an Age of Discovery. Shape the first contact between the Old World of the [Kindred](docs/character_creation/race/index) and the underground civilizations native to the [City Below](docs/the_frontier/index).

<!-- #### Less is More

Naevis is based on D&D's _[Basic Rules](docs/more/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf)_. There are fewer classes, races, and spells than found in the _Player's Handbook_. A player's skill is tested against their ability to make use of their options effectively and creatively.  -->

<!-- It is comparable to other D&D settings such as the _Forgotten Realms_, _Eberron_, or _Dark Sun_. -->
